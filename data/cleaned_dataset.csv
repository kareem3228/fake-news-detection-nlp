1,"a nightclub fire in the popular indian resort region of goa has killed at least people including four tourists, officials said. the state’s chief minister pramod sawant said that the fire was started by indoor fireworks at the nightclub in arpora village around midnight on saturday local time, cnn affiliate news reported. police had earlier suggested that a cylinder blast caused the blaze, but sawant said the preliminary inquiry showed the fire was triggered by electrical firecrackers. fourteen of the victims are believed to have been staff, and the nationalities of the tourists are not yet confirmed, police told the english-language indian news channel. seven people are being treated for injuries, including one person with % burns, it added. four managers of the nightclub have been arrested, local police said, according to news. eyewitness told the news channel that the nightclub was “jam packed” with a large weekend crowd. at least persons were on the dance floor, according to fatima shaikh, a tourist speaking to news. “there was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting. we rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,” shaikh said. a temporary structure covered in palm leaves quickly caught fire, she added. goa, a small state on india’s west coast known for its beaches and portuguese heritage, attracts hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists and millions of domestic tourists every year. “today is a very painful day for all of us in goa,” sawant said sunday morning in a post on x. videos on social media showed fire trucks and ambulances lining up to help the injured. goa’s health minister vishwajit rane said on x that the injured were taken to goa medical college and hospital, and are receiving “the best possible medical care,” with teams working through the night. some of the victims succumbed to burn injuries and others died due to suffocation, news reported. a general view shows the burned nightclub following a fire that broke out last midnight in goa on december , . afp/getty images “in this moment of profound grief, we stand firmly with the affected families, assuring them of our unwavering support in every possible way,” rane added. india’s prime minister narendra modi said the fire was “deeply saddening” and pledged that his office would offer compensation of up to , rupees ($,) to each family of those killed and , rupees ($) to the injured. “my thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones,” he said on x. “may the injured recover at the earliest.” an inquiry has been ordered to “examine the exact cause of the fire and whether fire safety norms and building rules were followed,” sawant said. early reports suggest the venue lacked the mandatory no objection certificate (noc) and violated fire regulations, the director of fire and emergency services nitin raiker told news on sunday. “fire services were rushed towards the spot immediately,” raiker told the channel. “in half an hour we extinguished the fire. noc was not given, fire norms were not followed by the club.” the state’s chief minister said the owners did not have permission to construct the club, and it had been issued with a demolition notice which was stayed by officials, news reported. this story has been updated with additional developments.",Real

4,"hamas is willing to discuss “freezing or storing” its weapons, a senior official said on sunday, amid concerns that the nascent ceasefire deal between israel and the militant group could collapse. speaking to the associated press in qatar on sunday, bassem naim said that hamas is “very open minded” about what to do with its remaining weaponry. the us-brokered ceasefire deal requires hamas to give up its arms under the supervision of independent monitors as part of the demilitarization of gaza. disarmament is a key part of the second phase of the -point ceasefire agreement. “we can talk about freezing or storing or laying down, with the palestinian guarantees, not to use it at all during this ceasefire time or truce,” naim told the ap. on sunday, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel is “very close” to moving to the second phase of the gaza ceasefire deal. but crucial details are still missing, including what countries will take part in an international security force intended for gaza, a critical part of the agreement. netanyahu emphasized israel’s priority in the next phase, which is “to disarm hamas and demilitarize gaza.” it is unclear if naim’s stated intention of “freezing or storing” weapons would meet israel’s demand for disarmament under the ceasefire. he emphasized that any international force, even under the mandate of a un security council resolution, would have limited authority in gaza. “we are welcoming a un force to be near the borders, supervising the ceasefire agreement, reporting about violations, preventing any kind of escalations,” he said. “but we don’t accept that these forces have any kind of mandates authorizing them to do or to be implemented inside the palestinian territories.” meanwhile at the doha forum on saturday, qatar, egypt and norway expressed their concern that the ceasefire is at risk, with negotiations over the next phase at a critical moment. “now, we are at a critical moment (of the gaza ceasefire),” said qatari prime minister mohammed bin abdulrahman al-thani. “it’s not yet there, so what we have just done is a pause.”",Real
5,"cairo ap — a drone attack by the sudanese paramilitary forces hit a kindergarten in south-central sudan, killing people, including children, a doctors’ group said. paramedics on the scene in the town of kalogi in south kordofan state were targeted in “a second unexpected attack,” sudan doctors’ network said in a statement late friday. emergency lawyers, a rights group tracking violence against civilians in sudan reported in a statement saturday the second strike on paramedics treating survivors in kalogi and said “a third civilian site near the previous two” was also attacked. the group condemned the attack, blaming the paramilitary group, the rapid support forces, or rsf, for the strikes, calling them “a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians, especially children, and vital civilian infrastructure.” the death toll is expected to be higher, but communication blackouts in the area have made it difficult to report casualties. thursday’s attack is the latest in the fighting between the rsf, and the sudanese military, who have been at war for over two years. it is now concentrating in the oil-rich kordofan states. “killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children’s rights,” said unicef representative for sudan sheldon yett in a statement friday. “children should never pay the price of conflict,” said yett. he said unicef urges all parties “to stop these attacks immediately and allow safe, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to reach those in desperate need.” hundreds of civilians were killed throughout the kordofan states in the last few weeks as intensified fighting shifted from darfur after the rsf took over the besieged city of el-fasher. sudanese military aerial strikes on sunday killed at least people, mostly civilians, in kauda, south kordofan. un human rights chief volker türk warned that kordofan could face new atrocities like those in el-fasher. separately, the rsf condemned in a statement friday a drone strike on the chad-sudan border, accusing the sudanese military of being behind it and posted a video showing billowing black smoke. this couldn’t be independently verified and it is unclear whether there were casualties in this strike. there was no immediate comment from the sudanese military. rsf’s violent takeover of el-fasher was marked with executions of civilians, rapes and sexual assaults, and other atrocities. thousands escaped and thousands more are feared killed or trapped in the city. the rsf and the sudanese military have been fighting for power over sudan since . more than , people were killed in the war, according to the world health organization, and million displaced. however, aid groups say the true death toll could be way higher.",Real
6,"reuters — japan said on sunday that chinese fighter jets had directed fire-control radar at japanese military aircraft in two “dangerous” incidents near japan’s okinawa islands, an account beijing denied. “these radar illuminations went beyond what is necessary for the safe flight of aircraft,” defense minister shinjiro koizumi posted on x, adding that japan had lodged a protest with china over saturday’s “regrettable” incident. meeting with australian defense minister richard marles in tokyo, koizumi said japan would respond “resolutely and calmly” to china’s conduct to maintain regional peace and stability. a chinese navy spokesperson, colonel wang xuemeng, said japanese aircraft had repeatedly approached and disrupted the chinese navy as it was conducting previously announced carrier-based flight training east of the miyako strait. strained ties over taiwan the encounters near islands claimed by both japan and china are the most serious run-ins between the two militaries in years and are likely to further escalate tension between the two east asian powers. relations have soured in the past month since prime minister sanae takaichi warned that japan could respond to any chinese military action against taiwan if it also threatened japan’s security. directing fire-control radar at another aircraft is a threatening step because it signals a potential attack and may force the targeted plane to take evasive action. japan did not say whether the chinese had locked on their planes or how japan’s aircraft responded. wang, in a statement on official social media channels, countered that japan’s statement was erroneous and its actions had seriously endangered flight safety. “we solemnly demand that the japanese side immediately stop slandering and smearing and strictly restrain front-line actions,” wang said. “the chinese navy will take necessary measures in accordance with the law to resolutely safeguard its own security and legitimate rights and interests.” australia’s marles, at a press conference with koizumi after discussions on deepening defense cooperation, said, “we are deeply concerned by the actions of china in the last hours. we will continue to work with japan and stand with japan in upholding that rules-based order.” as china-japan tensions over taiwan have mounted, beijing advised its citizens not to travel to japan and paused plans to restart seafood imports suspended after japan released treated water from the crippled fukushima nuclear plant. china claims democratically governed taiwan and has ramped up military and political pressure against the island, whose government rejects beijing’s territorial claims. taiwan lies just km ( miles) from japan’s westernmost island, yonaguni. japan hosts the biggest overseas concentration of us military power, including warships, aircraft and thousands of us marines in okinawa. the us state department and the us embassy in tokyo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on japan’s claims about china’s use of its fire-control radar. trump silent, china steps up military activity us ambassador to japan george glass has publicly expressed support for japan in several social media posts since the diplomatic dispute began, but president donald trump and other senior us officials have remained silent. trump, who plans to visit beijing next year for trade talks, telephoned takaichi last month, urging her not to escalate the dispute, people with knowledge of the matter told reuters. that call followed a conversation between trump and chinese president xi jinping, who told trump that taiwan’s return to china was central to beijing’s vision for the world order, the official xinhua news agency reported. japan said the chinese j- jets involved in the two incidents were launched from china’s liaoning aircraft carrier, which was maneuvering south of the okinawan islands with three missile destroyers. japan said it scrambled f- fighters in response to flight operations from the chinese carrier. in , japan said a chinese warship locked fire-control radar on one of its destroyers in the east china sea. three years later, beijing accused japanese jets of directing fire-control radar at chinese fighters. in june, japan said chinese jets flew dangerously close to one of its patrol aircraft near okinawa. on thursday, china had more than naval and coast guard vessels deployed across east asian waters at one point, reuters reported, citing sources and intelligence reports. taiwan’s government described that build-up as posing a threat to the indo-pacific region. japan said it was monitoring chinese activity closely. on sunday, taiwan’s coast guard said it was monitoring drills by three chinese maritime safety ships on the western side of the taiwan strait’s median line but that the situation in the waters surrounding taiwan was “normal.” chinese state media said the search-and-rescue drills were in the central waters of the strait, patrolling “high-traffic areas, and areas with frequent accidents.” taiwan’s coast guard said china was using “misleading and false wording” about what it was doing, with the aim of harassing taiwan and carrying out psychological warfare. china says it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait, a major trade route for about half of global container ships. the united states and taiwan say the strait is an international waterway.",Real
7,"investigations are underway in ireland and france after two more incidents this week involving unidentified drones flying close to the coastlines of each country. on monday night, several drones were seen flying off the coast of dublin, just as the plane carrying ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky was about to land ahead of his first official visit to ireland. on thursday night, several drones flew close to a french naval base on the atlantic coast housing nuclear ballistic missile submarines, french prosecutors told local media. the two incidents are the latest in a string of unexplained sightings in several european countries since september. some drones have disrupted civilian air traffic, while others have flown close to airbases and other military facilities. european officials have said that they believe russia is behind at least some of the incidents, but no drone has been retrieved or shot down. russian president vladimir putin has previously ridiculed claims that moscow was behind drone sightings in europe. french prosecutors told french media that none of the drones that flew near the ile longue submarine base in northwestern france had been shot down and none of their pilots identified. it is not clear where the drones came from. prosecutor frederic teillet told afp that “no link with foreign interference” had been established at this stage. french marines at the base had used a jammer against the drones, he added. “an investigation is underway that will determine what this overflight was all about,” french defense minister catherine vautrin told broadcaster tf on friday. drone flights are banned on the crozon peninsula, where the submarine base and other military infrastructure is located. a nuclear submarine at the naval base in ile longue, france, on december , . fred tanneau/afp/getty images irish police have said little about the incident on monday, telling cnn on friday that a special detective unit is investigating “and will be liaising with the defence forces and international security partners.” ukrainian media quoted an adviser to zelensky, dmytro lytvyn, as saying that ukrainian officials were made aware of the drones, but no action was deemed necessary. “the host side is responsible for security,” lytvyn said. “according to their data, there were indeed such drones, but this did not affect the visit and there was no need to force any change to the visit.” european commission president ursula von der leyen has called the recent spate of incursions “hybrid warfare.” in september, denmark’s prime minister mette frederiksen said that while authorities could not be sure who was behind the incidents, “we can at least conclude that there is primarily one country that poses a threat to europe’s security – and that is russia.” many of the drone sightings have been close to the coastlines of baltic and other european nations, raising concerns that russia may be using ships as drone platforms. reuters has previously reported that a russian ship called the boracay, one of hundreds of sanctioned tankers that move russian oil, was about nautical miles ( km) south of copenhagen, heading out of the baltic sea, when drone activity forced the closure of the city’s airport on september . it was also observed traveling south along denmark’s western coast on september , when drones were reported flying north of esbjerg and near several nearby airports, according to reuters. the kremlin said at the time it had no information about the vessel but added that the russian military had to act sometimes to restore order when foreign countries had taken what spokesman dmitry peskov described as “provocative actions.” the boracay was subsequently boarded by french authorities and its chinese captain charged with failing to provide proof of the vessel’s nationality and failing to comply with orders.",Real
8,"syrian president ahmed al-sharaa has accused israel of exporting crises to other countries and “fighting ghosts,” amid persistent incursions and air strikes by israeli forces into southern syria. al-sharaa was speaking at the doha forum in qatar on saturday, in a conversation with cnn’s chief international anchor christiane amanpour. syria’s interim president again demanded that the israel agree to reinstate the deconfliction agreement that separated syrian and israeli forces. israeli forces crossed into southern syria a year ago, as the assad regime fell, and continue to occupy the strategic heights of mount hermon. the summit, which overlooks israel, lebanon and syria, had been in a buffer zone for the previous years. israeli officials have said the israel defense forces will remain in the places they occupied a year ago indefinitely. syria was adamant about respecting the agreement and would not accept an alternative buffer zone, al-sharaa said. “we demand israel to go back to the pre-december () lines,” he said, adding that the united states was taking part in negotiations. attempts to revise the agreement would “send us into a serious and dangerous place,” he said. “who will be protecting this buffer zone or this demilitarized zone if the syrian army or syrian forces aren’t going to be there?” he asked. “syria has suffered massive violations of our airspace, and we’ve been victim of over , air strikes and over incursions” since the revolution a year ago, al-sharaa said. at least people were killed during an israeli military raid in southern syria late last month. cnn's chief international anchor christiane amanpour, left, speaks with syrian president ahmed al-sharaa at the doha forum. ibraheem abu mustafa/reuters al-sharaa’s rebel forces entered the syrian capital last december, forcing then president bashar al-assad to flee. al-sharaa repeated that his government would hold to account those involved in abuses earlier this year in syria’s coastal zone, when hundreds of minority alawites were killed. many alawites had supported the assad regime. despite the atrocities committed then, syria was a state of law, he said, and reinforcing the rule of law was the way to guarantee the rights of all minorities. as to elections, al-sharaa said his current mandate would be for a further four years, while a constitution is drafted and institutions built. at that point, elections would take place, he said. an indirect parliamentary election held in october was marred by concerns about representation of women and minorities. only a small fraction of the population was able to vote. al-sharaa also told the forum that he had met members of the us congress during a recent visit to washington to push for the repeal of the caesar act, which continues to enforce some sanctions against syria but was recently waived for a further days. “there was a great understanding, and i believe we’re at the % point,” he said. the economic situation in syria was stabilizing, he said, and it was seeing the first indications of economic growth. “there was a great understanding, and i believe we’re at the % point,” he said. the economic situation in syria was stabilizing, he said, and it was seeing the first indications of economic growth. there is substantial investment in syria, mainly due to financing from saudi arabia and qatar, and with the growing participation of foreign energy and construction firms. “people were receiving an hour and a half of electricity per day, and now we have reached to hours per day and hopefully this year we will be self-sufficient in terms of electricity,” al-sharaa said.",Real

12,"the streets of caracas are decorated with christmas lights. the sound of traditional venezuelan christmas music can be heard everywhere. daily routines seem undisturbed: children attending school, adults going to work, vendors opening their businesses. beneath this facade lurks anxiety, fear, and frustration, with some even taking preventative measures against a possible attack amid the tension between the united states and venezuela. a woman who asked to be identified as victoria for fear of reprisals has lived alone in western caracas since her two children left the country and currently works in commerce. she describes her routine in recent months as marked by uncertainty, with each day bringing unsettling developments that rob her of peace of mind. although she hasn’t stopped doing her daily tasks, victoria confesses that this state of alert, with the constant question of what might happen next, has disrupted her sleep. sometimes, she says, she gets up in the middle of the night and starts checking the news on her phone, even though she acknowledges that doing so makes it harder to fall back to sleep. “there’s a confrontation in which we, ordinary citizens, have nothing to do,” she says, referring to the potential conflict between her country and the trump administration. “we try to carry on with our daily lives, we try to carry on with our daily activities, but that’s always interrupted by the whole situation we’re experiencing, which undoubtedly affects us.” victoria says she has to take natural sleeping pills to fall asleep, that she doesn’t want to talk to anyone, and that she’s even experienced physical discomfort as a result. “only those of us in these shoes feel it,” victoria says. venezuelans are “hardworking, good-hearted people. they don’t deserve everything that’s happening to us,” she says. emotional impact the prolonged political tension between venezuela and the united states has affected the mental health of venezuelans in recent months, according to yorelis acosta, a clinical and social psychologist and research coordinator at the center for development studies of the central university of venezuela. “there is no single way to process what is happening to us,” she says. acosta explains that how each person perceives and deals with the crisis depends on where they live and their connection to their surroundings, among other factors. “it’s not the same for a venezuelan from táchira or zulia, who lives on the border, as it is for someone from caracas.” she adds that one must also consider those who are outside the country, many of whom feel that venezuela “is at war or completely militarized,” when the reality is quite different. according to acosta, perceptions also vary between those who prefer to stay out of the issue and those who are hyperconnected, sometimes misinformed, or over-informed, and suffering from high levels of anxiety and insomnia. she recommends maintaining a healthy relationship with the news and social media to avoid information overload. “we need to stay informed, yes, but from reliable sources and for a limited time. we can’t spend all day hyperconnected. we also need to take breaks, move around, breathe, and prioritize physical and mental well-being,” she says. some people, like yanitza albarrán, focus on maintaining a routine and peace. while participating in a march supporting venezuelan president nicolás maduro on december , albarrán told cnn that she was committed to freedom, peace and the bolivarian revolution, which she says the president represents. venezuela's president nicolas maduro waves while holding the hand of his wife cilia flores during a ceremony in caracas, venezuela, on monday. leonardo fernandez viloria/reuters “mothers are taking their children to school, women are going out to work, teaching at universities. farmers are planting, merchants are selling. our country is at peace because our president nicolás maduro and the entire national armed forces guarantee it,” she asserted, before rejoining the march. that day, to the rhythm of “no war, yes peace,” the president’s slogan, several people marched, supporting the government’s position: normal life, untouchable venezuela. but not everyone is experiencing the moment like albarrán, and the arrival of christmas is adding to the economic and political tensions. “for some, december is a reason to celebrate. but for others, it is a reminder of absences. many miss their relatives who are abroad or face the loss of loved ones,” says acosta. and the feelings become even more complex in an increasingly isolated venezuela. preventive measures fear has also led to concrete measures. cnn has obtained notes from some private schools in caracas, asking parents and guardians to submit an “individual emergency kit” for each student who will be attending school during the year. the kit must contain water, non-perishable food, hygiene items, and medications, if necessary, as well as flashlights. the rationale is that such kits could be needed in case a student has to spend the night at school, especially in the event of an earthquake. however, a parent who spoke with cnn and requested anonymity for fear of possible repercussions believes the request is meant to prepare for other scenarios related to the tensions between caracas and washington. a venezuelan navy patrol boat patrols near the el palito refinery in puerto cabello, venezuela on november . juan carlos hernandez/afp/getty images since the us started attacking vessels in the caribbean and pacific on september , trump has repeatedly hinted at the possibility of an operation in venezuelan territory, although it’s not clear whether this will materialize or when it might occur. this climate of uncertainty has led some companies to take other preventative measures. some business owners who spoke with cnn, and who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, said they are constantly monitoring road conditions in different parts of the country to ensure their products are distributed, and are conducting communication drills with their employees to alert them in case of any extraordinary situation. anxiety compounded by isolation several airlines suspended their flights to and from venezuela after the us’s federal aviation administration on november urged aircraft to exercise extreme caution when flying over the country and the southern caribbean, citing a potentially dangerous situation. venezuelan authorities, after giving these airliners hours to resume operations, decided to revoke their flight permits in the country. when victoria read that news, she felt “a complete collapse” and “the deepest sadness.” the announcement nearly buried the possibility of visiting her daughter in france, something she hasn’t done in two years. “i felt like the world was crashing down on me when i heard the news,” she confesses, adding that she feels fear in seeing the country becoming increasingly isolated. she is still exploring travel options via colombia, panama or curaçao to reunite with her family, though she is also worried she might be taking a risk by traveling under the current circumstances. although december is usually the ideal time to see loved ones, many are now unable to reunite with family since nearly eight million venezuelans live

13,"looking at the weather map on his computer and seeing three tropical storms forming simultaneously across asia in late november, climatologist fredolin tangang’s first thoughts drifted to the disaster movie “the day after tomorrow.” the film, in which three massive storms plunge the earth into a new ice age, goes beyond the realms of reality. but there was something about the formation of these weather systems swirling across his screen that made tangang sit up. they were not the strongest storms this year. but they were “unusual,” said tangang, emeritus professor at the national university of malaysia. one was churning near the equator off the coast indonesia – an area where storms rarely take shape because the planet’s spin is too weak there to whip them into existence. another was tracking for parts of sri lanka that are rarely hit by tropical storms. the third was late in the season, and on course to dump yet more rain on already soaked terrain in vietnam and the philippines. “you realize this is like a monster,” tangang said. the cyclonic storms went on to unleash torrential rains and catastrophic flooding – including, in one area, the second-wettest day recorded anywhere in history – across swathes of south and southeast asia. they killed more than , people, according to a cnn tally from disaster agencies’ figures. satellite images from planet labs shows flooding in north eastern aceh on indonesia's sumatra island on september , and november , . planet labs pbc multiple countries are struggling to recover from their worst flooding in decades. hundreds of people remain missing – likely washed away in rapid torrents of floodwater or buried beneath thick mud and debris. the region is used to monsoon rains and frequent flooding, but the enormity of the human toll and level of destruction have shocked many, with scientists warning that, as the climate crisis intensifies, more intense extreme weather events will become the new normal. “this is a human tragedy. it’s multiple conditions happening at the same time, and that makes it rather unprecedented,” tangang said. rare storms in unusual places “relentless,” “rare” and “record-breaking” are the words that scientists have used to describe the biblical deluges across thousands of miles from sri lanka to indonesia, malaysia, thailand, vietnam, and the philippines. driving the disaster, experts say, was an extraordinary mix of overlapping powerful weather systems, amplified by the man-made climate crisis. tropical storm senyar formed just north of the equator in the strait of malacca, the waterway between indonesia’s sumatra and the malaysian peninsula – a rare occurrence that may have helped magnify the disaster as communities there weren’t used to experiencing cyclones, tangang said. storms rarely take shape near the equator, because the planet’s spin is too weak there to provide the coriolis force that gets a cyclone rotating. in another unusual twist, the storm made a u-turn and moved south and eastwards – highly uncommon in this part of the world, where the earth’s rotation means storms tend to track west and move northwards, he added. meanwhile, cyclone ditwah was creeping along sri lanka’s east and north coasts, dumping massive bands of rain onto low-lying, beachy coastline and central hill country – an area that was similarly not experienced in dealing with tropical storms. typhoon koto’s rains triggered flooding and landslides in the philippines, which had suffered back-to-back deadly typhoons and extensive flooding, before it moved toward an already saturated vietnam. a cold surge in the weeks before had blown strong winds from the north across the south china sea, where they collected moisture and dumped it in the form of rain over thailand and malaysia. an already soaked region in early november, two major typhoons in less than a week carved a path of destruction through the philippines. fung-wong’s footprint spanned nearly the entirety of the archipelago, and kalmaegi killed at least people before hitting vietnam as one of the strongest typhoons on record there. communities in central vietnam had barely recovered from widespread flooding and landslides that killed at least people, submerged historic neighborhoods and devastated farmland. one meteorological station in central vietnam recorded a national -hour rainfall record of , millimetres, according to clare nullis, world meteorological organization spokesperson. a woman rows a boat on a flooded street following heavy rains in hoi an, vietnam on october , . nhac nguyen/afp/getty images “that’s really, really enormous. it’s the second-highest known total anywhere in the world for -hour rainfall,” she said at a briefing in geneva. like a sponge full of water, the land could not take any more moisture. people had lost their homes and livelihoods and were facing yet more loss. then came koto, senyar, and ditwah, which “created back-to-back pulses of rainfall that hit already saturated river basins,” said joseph basconcillo, a senior weather specialist at the philippine atmospheric, geophysical and astronomical services administration. “once the surface was soaked, additional rain quickly turned into severe flooding.” surging flash floods and landslides quickly overwhelmed entire communities, catching many people off guard. “the combination of unusual storm tracks and vulnerable landscapes made the impacts far more extreme,” said basconcillo. adding to the chaotic cocktail, two natural climate phenomena that usually bring above-average rainfall to the region were occurring simultaneously: la niña and a negative indian ocean dipole. la niña and the negative indian ocean dipole cannot explain the disaster alone, but they “created a background environment that made intense rainfall more likely,” said basconcillo. “the worst impacts occurred when this moisture aligned with strong storms and vulnerable terrain.” in hat yai, in thailand’s southern songkhla province, floodwaters as high as eight feet surged through the streets, which resident wassana suthi described as “like a tsunami.” a woman walks among tree trunks that stranded on a shore following deadly flash floods and landslides, in padang, west sumatra province, indonesia, on november , . willy kurniawan/reuters in sumatra, indonesia – the worst-hit country, where at least people were killed – rescue teams are still trying to reach villages cut off by washed-out roads and collapsed bridges. abdul ghani, a resident of palembayan town in west sumatra, spent days looking for his missing wife, showing a photo of her to everyone he met. “i hope they find her body, even if it’s just a piece of her hand,” he told the news agency reuters. a thousand miles away on the other side of the indian ocean in sri lanka, neighborhoods were swept away and residents continue the search for bodies in the thick mud and debris. “we could only hear a sound like thunder,” nawaz nashra, from alawathugoda village in kandy, told reuters. “the house next to ours collapsed as we watched. there was no time to warn anyone.” ‘accumulation of catastrophic events’ southeast and south asia are among the most vulnerable places on earth to the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis, for which rich, industrialized nations bear greater historical responsibility. asia is warming almost twice as fast as the global average. hotter ocean temperatures provide greater energy for storms to strengthen, and climate change is supercharging rainfall events as the warmer air can hold more moisture, which it then wrings out over towns, cities and communities. researchers say they are now seeing a pattern unfolding: an “accumulation of catastrophic events.” “what we’re witnessing in southeast asia is a relentless cycle of storms: weeks of heavy rainfall during an extreme monsoon season, with record-breaking events happening time and time again,” davide faranda, research director at the french national center for scientific research said in a statement. “this cannot be accepted as the norm.” an urgent phase-out of fossil fuels, which release planet-heating pollution, is vital to stave off the worst of the climate crisis. but greater investment is also needed to help vulnerable countries adapt to the impacts already happening year after year. “as climate change increases the intensity of heavy rainfall events, investments in stronger warnings, better land-use planning, upgraded infrastructure, and nature-based solutions become essential,” said basconcillo. other man-made factors likely exacerbated the disaster, including environmental degradation and rampant deforestation – often worsened or abetted by official corruption. in indonesia, residents and government officials have pointed to the decades of deforestation from illegal logging, mining and palm oil plantations on sumatra that has degraded the landscape, leaving hillsides more prone to flooding and landslides. similarly in the philippines, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets protesting corruption over flood control projects. meanwhile, sri lanka is only starting to rebound from its worst financial crisis in seven decades, that has left little for funding infrastructure or public health, according to the world bank. filipinos shout and raise placards during an anti-corruption protest over widespread graft allegations linked to government infrastructure projects, in manila, philippines, on november , . eloisa lopez/reuters at the cop summit in brazil last month, the world struck a new deal that called for a tripling of funds to help countries adapt to increasingly severe climate impacts. but countries failed to agree to a roadmap away from fossil fuels, and there were no explicit commitments on deforestation or funding pledges. “the science is really clear, things are getting worse,” said climatologist tangang. “it’s time for the world, for governments to be serious in not only in fixing the climate but to ensure that their own backyard is ready to face the impacts of climate change,” he added. “we don’t want countries getting poorer, people getting poorer, and more families losing their lives because of this.” this week, more rains are forecast for sumatra and sri lanka. a fresh storm is brewing to the east of the philippines.",Real
14,"wellington, new zealand ap — new zealand police said friday they have recovered a james bond-inspired fabergé pendant after six days of closely watching the man accused of swallowing the jewelry in an auckland store. they said the pendant was recovered thursday night after it exited the suspect’s gastrointestinal tract naturally without medical intervention. the limited-edition, fabergé egg pendant was inspired by the james bond film “octopussy,” in which a jewel-smuggling operation involves a fake fabergé egg. a less glamorous photo supplied by new zealand’s police friday showed a gloved hand holding the recovered pendant and its long, gold chain with an intact price tag showing the jewelry’s , new zealand dollar ($,) value. the man was arrested inside partridge jewelers in auckland on november shortly after the alleged theft. he made a court appearance november , when he didn’t enter a plea to a charge of theft. since then, he’s been in police custody and officers had been stationed round the clock with the man to wait for the evidence to reemerge. the -year-old man has not been publicly named. he is due to appear in auckland district court on monday and will remain in police custody until then. “given this man is in police custody, we have a duty of care to continue monitoring him given the circumstances of what has occurred,” inspector grae anderson said in a statement wednesday. the store’s website says the egg, one of only made, was crafted from gold, painted with green enamel and encrusted with diamonds and two sapphires. the pendant is . centimeters (. inches) tall and is mounted on a stand. “the egg opens to reveal an ct yellow gold octopus nestled inside, adorned with white diamond suckers and black diamond eyes,” an item description said. “the octopus surprise pays homage to the eponymous antagonist at the center of the ‘octopussy’ film.”",Real

18,"“america alone” might be the simplest précis of the white house’s new national security strategy, an extraordinary document released friday that starkly lays out the administration’s broad foreign policy priorities. in a -page wall of words and grievances that self-summarizes as “america first,” it manages to reject european allies with a borderline racist swipe, concede the united states must share power with china and search for new allies in the western hemisphere, where currently washington has few. at times, it would be facile enough to be funny, but the stakes are anything but. “the days of the united states propping up the entire world order like atlas are over,” the paper declares early on, although it is unclear if this is a statement of past fact, or a new policy. the place sought for the us in this new world is no clearer either: no longer top dog, more snarling at other rising hounds. “as the united states rejects the ill-fated concept of global domination for itself, we must prevent the global … domination of others,” it says. “the outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations.” the meteoric ascent of china, it says, came at the expense of the us (with little mention of the role cheap goods played in rising us living standards for decades) but can only be checked, not stopped. the white house sees potential for friends nearer home in the americas, but risks disappointment. the “trump corollary” it declares to the monroe doctrine of the s provides an appendix to an ages-old proposal the us should dominate nearest its own shores, rather than providing a new idea for . it also fails to mention how few potent allies the united states actually has to its south, as it threatens to bomb narco-networks at will, while pardoning the former corrupt president of drug-plagued honduras. repeatedly, the strategy rides high on weighty, serious rhetoric, yet lacks ideas to match the moment. there is sometimes light relief, notably in the phrase: “conflict remains the middle east’s most troublesome dynamic,” as if it has just narrowly beaten hot weather to the top spot. but a few sentences later, the reductive trope: “the israeli-palestinian conflict remains thorny,” is a reminder of how many thousands of lives are in the sway of this wobbly, dismissive thinking at the helm of the world’s military superpower. it reads like a fortified, academic translation of president donald trump’s longer oval office soliloquies. there are moments that borrow prejudices and gripes more

favorite bete noir: europe. the echoes of vice president jd vance’s corrosive speech in february at the munich security conference run through two pages which accuse – without evidence – european allies of suppressing free speech and democracy, while crippling their own economies through over-regulation. it claims a majority of europeans are denied democratic expression of their desire for peace with russia – a reductive take on a continent eager to avoid another conflagration , and seeing the russian threat manifest itself in sabotage across their capitals. the strategy borrows from those on europe’s extremities when it dips into the racist “great replacement” theory to state that europe faces “civilizational erasure.” “it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain nato members will become majority non-european.” in other words, europe will be less white, will therefore turn on america’s alliances when they are “unrecognizable in years or less” and not necessarily “strong enough to remain reliable allies.” it goes further , to suggest the remedy of “cultivating resistance to europe’s current trajectory within european nations” – a nod to overt interference. us president donald trump speaks to reporters as he meets with nato secretary general mark rutte in the oval office of the white house in washington, dc, on october , . jim watson/afp/getty images russia is spared, unsurprisingly, similar criticism, and deemed a relationship worthy of “strategic stability.” the us is familiarly cast not as a nato ally to europe, but a mediator “to mitigate the risk of conflict between russia and european states.” it slams “european officials who hold unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority governments,” where popular desire for peace is trampled by censorship and the suppression of democracy (a false premise). a lack of self-awareness is present in its next criticism of europe as being a military power afraid to defend itself. “this lack of self-confidence is most evident in europe’s relationship with russia,” it notes, ignoring trump’s red-carpet welcome for russian president vladimir putin, whose economy is smaller than italy’s and whose military still can’t conquer its weaker neighbor. the priority? “an expeditious cessation of hostilities in ukraine,” reestablishing “strategic stability” with russia, and ukraine’s “survival as a viable state.” the path to this enduring and elusive trump goal is not addressed, yet the words “survival” and “viable” do not suggest any one ahead will be kind to kyiv. putin even gets an undeniable gift, when they call for “ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of nato as a perpetually expanding alliance.” there are few viable candidates now, but the point is not to spell that out. it is a profoundly unserious document, for a profoundly serious time, describing trump’s policy as “pragmatic without being ‘pragmatist,’ realistic without being ‘realist,’ principled without being ‘idealistic,’ muscular without being ‘hawkish,’ and restrained without being ‘dovish.’” fittingly in a time of enduring culture wars, the

21,"editor’s note: this story contains disturbing images. missing in gaza: cnn investigation points to the israeli military bulldozing the dead bodies of palestinians seeking aid : • source: cnn missing in gaza: cnn investigation points to the israeli military bulldozing the dead bodies of palestinians seeking aid : jerusalem — ammar wadi knew he was risking his life when he set out to get a bag of flour for his family from an aid truck near the zikim crossing into gaza in june. “forgive me mom if anything happens to me,” he wrote on his cell phone’s home screen. “whoever finds my phone, please tell my family that i love them so much.” amid regular israeli gunfire toward aid seekers this summer, wadi never made it home and the message he left was delivered to his family weeks later by someone who found his phone. it was the last they heard from him. wadi is among the dozens of palestinians whose loved ones say they vanished near zikim and whose fates remain unknown. a cnn investigation now points to the israeli military bulldozing the bodies of some of those killed near the crossing into shallow, unmarked graves. at other times, their remains were simply left to decompose in the open, unable to be recovered in the militarized area. the practice of mishandling bodies by bulldozing them into unmarked graves can violate international law, according to legal experts. cnn’s review, which also found that aid seekers were killed by indiscriminate israeli fire near the crossing, drew upon hundreds of videos and photos from around zikim, along with interviews of eyewitnesses and local aid truck drivers. satellite imagery also shows bulldozing activity throughout the summer in the areas where aid seekers were killed. two videos, geolocated by cnn to the zikim area, show the aftermath of an incident in june, depicting bodies partially buried around an overturned aid truck. cnn spoke with two former israeli military members who described instances elsewhere in gaza during the war in which the bodies of palestinians were bulldozed into shallow graves. they requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. the israel defense forces (idf) denied that it used bulldozers to “remove” bodies, but did not address whether they were used to bury them. the idf told cnn the presence of bulldozers around zikim was a “routine matter” used for operational purposes, such as dealing with explosive threats or “routine engineering needs.” according to international law, the warring sides should cooperate in burying the dead in a way that allows them to be identified, said janina dill, co-director of the oxford institute for ethics, law and armed conflict. “the purpose is to prevent the dead from becoming the missing and to allow for memorialization, chiefly by their families,” dill said. “moreover, if bodies are deliberately mutilated or mishandled in a way that violates their dignity, this can amount to ‘outrages upon personal dignity’ which is a war crime under the geneva conventions.” whether the idf tracks sites where it has allegedly buried bodies remains an open question, however. one of the idf whistleblowers told cnn that when his unit buried nine people in early , the location of the grave was left unmarked. the idf did not respond to cnn’s question about this incident. nearly six months after wadi’s disappearance, his family is still without answers. instead of finding comfort in his final phone message, however, wadi’s mother, nawal musleh, is haunted by what she may never discover. “when he comes to my mind, my eyes just cannot stop crying,” she told cnn. “we accept whatever god has written for us, but we just want to know what happened to our son.” ‘it’s like the bermuda triangle’ a pair of graphic videos posted to social media from september – reviewed and geolocated by cnn – show a steady stream of palestinians fleeing from the zikim area hauling sacks of flour under a barrage of gunfire. at least one person carrying flour appears to be shot from behind in the footage, with the gunfire seeming to come from the direction of an idf position that cnn has identified in satellite imagery. robert maher of montana state university, an audio forensics expert, analyzed the videos for cnn and found the shots originated around meters (, feet) from the filming location, which corresponds to the distance from the idf position. in the other video, a group can also be seen tending to the bodies of one apparently dead and another severely injured person, before carrying them away. meanwhile, the gunfire continues. in a statement to cnn, the idf said it “does not intentionally shoot at innocent civilians” and in instances where a threat arises, “fire is carried out for warning purposes or to neutralize the threat.” other footage and photos reviewed by cnn show multiple corpses that could not be retrieved from zikim by other aid seekers or the civil defense due to the dangerous conditions. on june , two eyewitnesses told cnn that one aid truck traveling from the crossing was swarmed by a crowd of hungry palestinians. the aid trucks are operated by private local contractors in gaza to pick up supplies from the crossing and drive them into the strip. shortly after the aid truck was surrounded, the israeli military opened fire toward the vehicle, with many people appearing to have been shot and collapsing beneath the truck, the eyewitnesses said. an ambulance operated by civil defense workers was permitted to access the area several days later. “we were shocked by the scene,” one of the civil defense workers told cnn, who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. “the (bodies) we recovered were decomposed – they had clearly been there for a while, there were signs that dogs had eaten parts of them.” a screen grab from the footage shows a partially buried body next to an overturned aid truck near the zikim crossing. a portion of this image has been obscured by cnn. obtained by cnn videos obtained and geolocated by cnn to that location in zikim show a crushed, overturned aid truck amid a pile of debris. several decomposing bodies are scattered around the vehicle, partially buried in mounds of sand. a stray dog is seen nearby. the civil defense team was only able to retrieve bodies and, with the ambulance full, roughly were never recovered, according to the worker. the idf did not respond to questions about this incident. a half dozen local aid truck drivers who worked the zikim route spoke to cnn on the condition of anonymity due to fears for their safety. they described scenes of strewn and decomposing bodies as a common sight, with israeli bulldozers at times clearing the corpses into the sand. “i see dead people every time i drive through zikim… i watched israeli bulldozers bury the dead bodies,” one driver said. “if you passed through that area in july, you wouldn’t miss it; i kept my windows closed.” “israeli army bulldozers either bury them or cover them with dirt,” another driver said. satellite imagery and photos add to these testimonies, capturing a standing presence of israeli bulldozers from late july to early august. signs of bulldozer activity around the zikim crossing are apparent beginning in mid-june, just after the aid route opened, until september , when it closed. some of the bulldozer activity appears related to clearing the aid route, which was frequently littered with boxes and debris. at other times, satellite imagery shows bulldozing activity without a clear purpose, such as when a bulldozer pushed a -square-meter (-square-foot) area of soil into a short pile in mid-june, around meters (, ft) away from where the overturned truck attended to by civil defense workers was found days earlier. the bulldozers were also repeatedly used to demolish the ruins of buildings behind which aid seekers previously sought shelter from israeli gunfire, as seen in numerous videos. two eyewitnesses told cnn that on september – as people went searching near zikim for any sign of their missing family members – they came across what they say appeared to be bulldozed corpses. “i found the bodies there bulldozed along with the cardboard (aid) boxes… they pile them on top of each other,” adel mansour told cnn, one of the eyewitnesses who went looking for his -year-old son. one aid truck driver who worked the zikim routes told cnn: “it’s like the bermuda triangle; no one knows what’s happening in that area, and it seems no one ever will.” idf whistleblowers speak out these reports of the israeli military bulldozing of the bodies of palestinians are not isolated to the zikim crossing. idf whistleblowers who spoke to cnn and the anti-occupation veterans’ ngo breaking the silence (bts) pointed to a broader pattern of the military mishandling the dead in gaza during the war. one idf whistleblower, who previously served at an outpost in the netzarim corridor, spoke to cnn on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. the soldier said that nine bodies of unarmed palestinians were left to decompose for nearly two days around his base in early . the smell of the rotting corpses became overwhelming as dogs scavenged the remains, he said. “our commander asked the ds – the bulldozers – to cover up the bodies with sand,” he recalled. “just to see this amount of bodies around you, when you see they’re unarmed, when you see dogs eating them to play with the bones and legs and skull. it’s terrible.” to the whistleblower’s knowledge, no photos were taken of the bodies to allow for later identification or to mark the location. “the families maybe don’t know what happened with their loved ones,” he said. bts, which provides a forum for israeli troops to speak out and verifies their accounts, also said that it had received numerous testimonies from soldiers on this practice. another former idf soldier – a captain who served in a command center overseeing israeli troops in gaza in late – said he never received any guidance from the military specifying the treatment of the bodies of palestinians killed in gaza. when the body of a palestinian killed by israeli forces blocked a road in gaza, he says officers in the command center ultimately decided to use a bulldozer to push the body into a shallow grave along the side of the road. “we were never given any protocol or any order of how to handle at all any bodies of either combatant or non-combatant that we came across in the war,” the whistleblower told cnn on condition of anonymity. the idf did not respond to cnn’s questions about the testimonies from former soldiers. following publication of this story, two human rights organizations called for investigations into the allegations. euro-med human rights monitor urged an independent probe, referencing cnn’s findings as well as its own work in documenting what it described as a “systematic policy” of burying palestinian bodies “under conditions that obstruct identification, conceal burial sites, and prevent families from learning the fate of their loved ones.” “findings revealed by cnn on the israeli army’s burial of palestinians near aid distribution points are consistent with what euro-med monitor has documented in recent months,” its statement said. similarly, the palestinian center for the missing and forcibly disappeared (pcmfd) called for an international investigation based on cnn’s reporting. the group called on the international committee of the red cross “to urgently access the area, accompany specialized rescue teams to retrieve remains, document burial sites, carry out identification where possible, and uphold families’ right to know the fate of their loved ones.” over the last two years, the israeli military has repeatedly buried the bodies of palestinians into unmarked, shallow or mass graves in locations across gaza. this includes hundreds of bodies uncovered last year at the nasser hospital in khan younis, according to authorities there, and the killing of aid workers in the south of the territory in march, which were detailed in a cnn report. the idf has consistently denied burying palestinians in mass graves. people gather near bodies lined up for identification after they were unearthed from a mass grave found in the nasser medical complex in the southern gaza strip in april . afp/getty images bulldozers have also been used at various points in the war by the idf to systematically destroy palestinian cemeteries. last year, a cnn investigation found that the israeli military desecrated at least cemeteries in its ground offensive in gaza, leaving gravestones ruined, soil upturned and, in some cases, bodies unearthed. the idf could not account for the destruction of the cemeteries identified, but said the military sometimes has “no other choice” but to target locations it claimed hamas uses for military purposes and explained that bodies were removed from some gravesites in attempts to rescue hostages. with many palestinians who tried to get food this summer still missing, the desperate search for answers continues for their families. some remain hopeful that their loved ones may still be alive somewhere, such as in israeli detainment or displaced elsewhere in gaza. “ammar (wadi) was someone whose absence leaves a huge void – losing him feels like losing a part of yourself,” his brother hossam said. “if he’s martyred, may god have mercy on him, but if he’s alive, at least we can hold on to hope.” this story has been updated to include statements from the human rights organizations euro-med human rights monitor and the palestinian center for the missing and forcibly disappeared. credits: senior producer/reporter: abeer salman investigative reporter/producer: yahya abou-ghazala visual investigations producer: thomas bordeaux jerusalem correspondent: jeremy diamond

22,"the leader of an anti-hamas group that was armed and backed by israel has been killed in gaza, the group confirmed thursday, in a potential blow to israel’s post-war plans in the shattered territory. yasser abu shabab, who led a militia controlling a patch of territory in rafah in southern gaza, was killed while trying to “de-escalate a conflict” between members of a family in a public square, the organization said. one israeli source said earlier the death resulted from “internal clashes.” two israeli sources said that israel tried to evacuate abu shabab to a hospital in the country’s south before he was pronounced dead. mourners pray before the body of slain militia leader yasser abu shabab, covered by a palestinian flag, during his funeral in east rafah in the southern gaza strip on thursday. from ghassan al-dahini/facebook abu shabab was the leader of the most prominent of several israeli-backed armed groups in gaza, and his death could prove to be a setback to israel’s still-unclear plans for the future of the enclave. abu shabab, who was in his early s, appeared to be spreading his reach slowly in southern gaza as he tried to carve out an area free of hamas. israel intended to use abu shabab’s militia to weaken hamas, as an alternative to the militant group’s islamist rule. israel also planned to use abu shabab’s organization, which he called the “popular forces,” to secure reconstruction projects inside israeli-occupied gaza under the next phase of the ceasefire deal. during the last several months of the war, abu shabab helped control the flow of aid from the kerem shalom crossing in southern gaza. hamas, which had previously vowed to target abu shabab, called him a traitor but did not explicitly claim responsibility for his death. the militant group said he faced “the inevitable fate of anyone who betrays their people and homeland, agreeing to be a pawn for the occupation.” in a statement, hamas commended all those who denounced abu shabab and others “collaborating” with israel. “we emphasize that the occupation, just as it failed to protect its agents, cannot protect any of its collaborators,” hamas added. the popular forces stressed that abu shabab was not killed by hamas. “we strongly deny any and all misleading reports suggesting that he was assassinated by thugs from the terroristic gang hamas, as it is way too weak to take out the general leader,” the group said in a statement. pictures circulated on multiple gaza messaging groups showed a number of palestinians celebrating abu shabab’s death. one picture obtained by cnn shows abu shabab with a red “x” over his face and calls him a “pig.” abu shabab was the leader of one of several loosely organized palestinian gangs that israel backs in gaza, and its members largely stay within the israeli-occupied part of the enclave. abu shabab’s group, which he claimed numbered in the hundreds, would carry out raids in hamas-controlled territory before retreating quickly back to israel’s protection, according to muhammad shehada, a gaza expert with the european council on foreign relations. in the absence of a post-war governance plan for gaza, israel has backed these armed groups, which have staked out small bits of territory in different parts of the strip. prime minister benjamin netanyahu called the gangs “a good thing,” even as his political rivals attacked him for arming “the equivalent of isis in gaza.” the ongoing operation to arm the groups, including that of abu shabab, was authorized without security cabinet approval, two israeli officials told cnn in june.",Real
23,"israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his coalition on wednesday boycotted a knesset vote endorsing us president donald trump’s plan for gaza. the vote, initiated by opposition leader yair lapid, passed with votes in favor and none against. as the period to debate the proposal began, members of netanyahu’s coalition fled the knesset plenum, hastily rushing to the exits as the vote neared. “i admit that i am surprised and disappointed that prime minister netanyahu is not here,” said lapid as the debate began. “this is the first opportunity given to us as a knesset to say to president trump, to say to the world, to say to ourselves – we are uniting around a common goal. netanyahu chose to boycott the vote and not come here. it’s a shame.” the largely symbolic measure states that “the israeli knesset decides to accept and adopt the -point plan of us president trump.” according to sources in the israeli opposition, the move aimed to “challenge and embarrass” netanyahu before the trump administration while sowing and exposing divisions within his far-right coalition. the proposal now heads to the foreign affairs and defense committee, where netanyahu’s coalition is likely to bury it. netanyahu publicly endorsed the plan during his september visit to the white house and welcomed its adoption by the un security council in november. however, the cabinet, which includes netanyahu’s far-right allies, has never formally discussed or voted on the full plan beyond the first phase of the ceasefire, which involved a partial israeli withdrawal from gaza in exchange for the return of the remaining living and deceased hostages. israel also agreed to release a number of palestinian prisoners and detainees. young palestinians play in a displacement camp in nuseirat, in the gaza strip on november . eyad baba/afp/getty images/file the second phase of the ceasefire plan acknowledges a pathway to “palestinian self-determination and statehood,” while calling for a reformed palestinian authority to eventually govern gaza. despite verbally agreeing to the plan, netanyahu has repeatedly pledged that he will not allow the establishment of a palestinian state. his coalition partners, far-right ministers itamar ben gvir and bezalel smotrich, have both rejected the trump plan. smotrich demanded on x in november that netanyahu “immediately formulate and appropriate and decisive response that will make it clear to the entire world - a palestinian state will never be established in our homeland.” ben gvir and other members already announced last week they will oppose lapid’s motion. “we will certainly vote against - if lapid wants to embarrass the state, that’s his business. a palestinian state will not be established,” heritage minister amichai eliyahu said on israel’s army radio last week. instead of voting against the proposal, netanyahu’s coalition left the room, allowing it to pass with opposition support. netanyahu himself has not publicly commented on lapid’s motion, but two coalition sources told cnn internal discussions have taken place in recent days as the group deliberated how to handle the vote. israeli opposition leader yair lapid speaks at the knesset in jerusalem, on october , the day of us president donald trump gave an address to the body. evelyn hockstein/pool/reuters/file ahead of the vote, lapid wrote on x that it should be “a moment of unity, reflecting the public unity for president trump’s and his team’s efforts,” adding that he expects netanyahu “to instruct his party members and his coalition members to support the proposal.” the opposition employed a similar tactic in a controversial vote in october, when the knesset gave a preliminary approval to a bill calling for israeli sovereignty over the occupied west bank during us vice president jd vance’s visit to israel. the measure passed by one vote, -, despite netanyahu’s request to withdraw it, as rebellious right-wing lawmakers defied him. vance condemned the move as an “insult” and a “very stupid political stunt,” while us secretary of state marco rubio called it “counterproductive” and “even threatening” to trump’s gaza peace plan. trump himself warned in an october interview with time magazine that “israel would lose all of its support from the us” if annexation happened. following the harsh us reactions, netanyahu’s office called the vote a “deliberate political provocation.” the israeli prime minister subsequently instructed his coalition whip not to advance any annexation related legislation.",Real
24,"khan younis, gaza — tamer abu assi was preparing breakfast for his two young boys saturday morning when he realized he had run out of firewood. fadi, , and jumaa, , went out to fetch some, as their father is paralyzed and wheelchair-bound. they never came back. abu assi was waiting for them to return so he could set the table, when nearby residents rushed to his shelter saying two kids had been targeted and killed by israeli troops. “are they my children?” he recalled asking. an agonizing wait ensued, as he went to identify the bodies. “i removed the shroud and hugged them. my little juju’s head was blown off; god rest his soul… his arms were severed and parts of his torso were gone,” he said, trembling. “fadi’s right hand and left leg were cut off,” he added. jumaa and fadi were killed by an israeli drone strike in the town of bani suheila, to the east of their shelter in khan younis, according to the family. the israel defense forces (idf) acknowledged carrying out the strike in a statement, calling the children “two suspects who crossed the yellow line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached idf troops operating in the southern gaza strip, posing an immediate threat to them.” “following the identification, the iaf (israeli air force) eliminated the suspects in order to remove the threat,” it continued. an invisible line bani suheila falls in territory occupied by israeli forces in gaza to the east of the so-called “yellow line.” but with few markers on the ground, it can be difficult to distinguish the contours of that line. since the ceasefire went into effect in october, palestinians have been killed frequently by israeli forces along the invisible demarcation line. the israeli military has repeatedly described them as “terrorists” who are “posing an immediate threat.” the deaths of the two children add to a gaza death toll that’s still rising seven weeks into the ceasefire. over the weekend, the palestinian ministry of health said more than , people have been killed since the october , , hamas attack in israel, including more than , women and , children. the number has steadily climbed as emergency crews recover bodies from the rubble. more than bodies have been retrieved since the ceasefire began, according to the ministry, but the number is still expected to rise dramatically. gaza’s civil defense has estimated that there are , bodies buried under the rubble throughout the shattered enclave. in addition, more than palestinians have been killed by israeli forces since the ceasefire began, the ministry said. a new report published by the platform, a coalition of israeli human rights organizations, concluded that saw “wider, deeper and unprecedented harm” to palestinian human rights in gaza and the occupied west bank. the report, obtained by cnn, described a “profound shift” in the nature of the war and “israel’s mechanisms of control” this year, one in which it said “extreme violations became standard operating procedure.” the day before jumaa was killed, he asked his father to sing his favorite song for him. abu assi wasn’t feeling too well and told him he would do it after his medical checkup the next day. “i told him, come with me to the checkup and i’ll sing all your favorite songs for you, my son,” abu assi said, remembering the final memory of his children, as tears streamed down his face.",Real
25,"what began as israel’s leader cold-shouldering the mainstream media is becoming a more widespread assault on the country’s freedom of the press. prime minister benjamin netanyahu has not granted an interview to israel’s three main broadcasters in over four years. he’s accused them of “brainwashing,” claimed they assist israel’s enemies and personally gone after journalists who criticize him. now, that longstanding tension is evolving into something more aggressive.: on monday, netanyahu’s coalition will establish a special parliamentary committee to advance legislation that would replace israel’s independent media regulators with political appointees. the change will give the government sweeping authority to fine and sanction news outlets – a move critics warn could permanently reshape the country’s media environment. the bill, sponsored by communications minister shlomo karhi, a netanyahu loyalist, passed its first reading last month after it was introduced in may. the government says its goal is to open the market, promote competition, remove outdated regulatory barriers and modernize israel’s media laws for the digital era. israeli networks, however, have warned the proposed reform will expand political influence and erode editorial independence. in an unprecedented move, the rival networks created a joint emergency forum in august to oppose the government’s plans, which they dub a “hostile takeover” of the media market. an official in the forum told cnn, “what we’re seeing is an attempted power grab on the eve on an election. the clear objective is to subdue the free press and silence criticism before israelis go to the polls.” ‘true freedom of expression’ the media regulation bill is part of a broader set of restrictions and measures taken against freedom of the press in israel. earlier this year, reporters without borders (rsf) dropped israel’s ranking to out of countries in the world press freedom index. “disinformation campaigns and repressive laws have multiplied in israel and pressure on israeli journalists has intensified,” rsf said. a bill originally aimed at banning qatar-based al-jazeera is currently being expanded to empower the government to shutter certain foreign outlets without court oversight in the name of “national security.” another bill would privatize israel’s public broadcaster, kan . defence minister israel katz recently announced he will close galei tzahal (army radio) next year. while some have questioned the existence of a military-run broadcaster in a democracy, the timing aligns with the government’s wider moves to consolidate control over the media sphere. and all of this is unfolding as israel has barred foreign journalists from independently entering gaza since the start of the war more than two years ago. reporters without borders said the ban constitutes “an unprecedented violation of press freedom and the public’s right to reliable, independent, and pluralistic media reporting.” the media regulation bill has already faced criticism from the national regulatory agency, the finance and justice ministries, the knesset’s own legal advisers and the attorney general. “the proposal creates increased risks to israel’s free media,” attorney general gali baharav-miara wrote in a legal opinion submitted to the government in september, raising “a real concern about commercial and political influence and involvement in the work of media organizations in general and in news broadcasts in particular.” despite legal objections from both the government’s legal adviser and the knesset’s legal counsel, karhi is pressing ahead. the communications minister, who accused the press of “weakening israel internally” in a knesset speech in november and claimed it enabled the hamas-led october attacks, argued in that the reform will create “true freedom of expression – not that of disgruntled people with microphones.” israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu, right, speaks to minister of communications shlomo karhi at the knesset, in jerusalem in . maya alleruzzo/ap as netanyahu’s government pushes to constrain and boycott critical reporting, it has simultaneously promoted pro-netanyahu channel – often called israel’s fox news – with regulatory benefits, including reduced distribution fees, and various reliefs allowing it to operate with fewer restrictions than other commercial channels. tehilla shwartz altshuler, a senior fellow at the israel democracy institute, said, “in the past two years, the israeli government has launched a coordinated political, regulatory and rhetorical campaign to weaken the media.” “coalition ministers and senior politicians routinely wage public assaults on journalists, blaming the media for national failures such as the events of october , while violent harassment of reporters has escalated”. ‘they want us to be afraid’ the pressure isn’t only institutional. individual journalists known for critical coverage of netanyahu and his government endure escalating threats and intimidation, much of it with tacit or explicit backing from members of netanyahu’s party and far-right coalition partners like national security minister itamar ben-gvir. guy peleg, channel ’s senior legal affairs correspondent, has faced protests outside his home, threatening messages and billboard campaigns calling for his imprisonment. the campaign against peleg, who regularly covers netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial, isn’t new. during the election, his face appeared on likud billboard adds alongside three other critical journalists under the slogan “they won’t decide”. the attacks intensified after peleg exposed the alleged abuse of a palestinian detainee at the sde teiman detention facility – an affair which recently led to the resignation of the idf’s top military lawyer. “they want us to be afraid,” peleg said on channel ’s flagship program, ulpan shishi. “they want us to go with security guards. what we have to say is that we will not give up and we will not be afraid and will continue doing our jobs.” right-wing activist mordechai david, known for confronting journalists and opposition figures, repeatedly harassed peleg, who eventually obtained a court-issued restraining order requiring david to stay at least two meters away. yet david has been welcomed by key coalition figures. ben-gvir hosted him in his knesset office, praising his protests as “excellent” and a “democratic mission.” tzvika foghel, of ben gvir’s far-right wing otzma yehudit party, invited him to a knesset committee hearing on journalist harassment, despite another restraining order – from opposition lawmaker gilad kariv. “the government embraces these people,” peleg told cnn. “they are honored guests at the knesset committees. we’re not talking about a few crazies who wrote a comment or sent a hateful message. we’re talking about a group that the government embraces, strengthens in many ways, thanks, and tells them to keep going.” peleg said the war against the media has several arms. “one is through legislation in the parliament, another is through the defense minister and the army radio and a third arm sends various fringe figures to run a campaign - both online and through harassment - which is essentially kind of terror,” he said. “it’s all part of one unified system”. netanyahu’s current political standing is already intertwined with the media. his media maneuvering eventually led to criminal investigations and indictments, as prosecutors allege he traded regulatory benefits for positive news coverage. the israeli prime minister is now formally seeking a pardon from israeli president isaac herzog in his long-running corruption trial while refusing to acknowledge any wrongdoing. the new mechanism netanyahu’s government now seeks to legalize would formalize similar arrangements, which critics say would allow government ministers to reward friendly outlets and penalize critical ones. the timing of the legislative push is significant. the next elections in israel are scheduled for october , unless netanyahu’s coalition collapses before then. in either scenario, israel is in an election year, where independent journalism is crucial for democratic accountability. “as israel enters an election year, its news organizations face unprecedented political pressure, regulatory threats, and physical intimidation,” altshuler told cnn, “leaving the public sphere more vulnerable than ever to influence, capture, and the erosion of democratic oversight.”",Real
26,"israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu formally requested a pardon in his long-running corruption trial, arguing it was in the “public interest.” in a letter addressed to president isaac herzog, netanyahu wrote that his trial has become “a focal point of fierce controversy” for which he bears “broad public and more responsibility, with an understanding of the overall ramifications of these events.” netanyahu said it was in his “personal interest” to prove his innocence in the ongoing trial, but “the public interest dictates otherwise.” the letter was dated thursday but submitted and publicized on sunday. as israeli head of state, herzog has the sole mandate to issue pardons. his office confirmed it received the request, and herzog would “consider it with great care and responsibility.” in the one-page letter, netanyahu does not include an admission of guilt or make any commitments about his political future. he has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. the formal request for a pardon is a reversal for the long-time israeli leader, who has said the indictments would collapse and that he would prove his innocence in court. “faced with the security challenges and diplomatic opportunities currently before the state of israel, i am committed to do everything in my power to heal the rifts, achieve national unity, and restore public trust in the state’s institutions,” netanyahu wrote, “and i expect all branches of government to do the same.” in a statement on monday, herzog said he would consider the request “in the most correct and precise manner” while acknowledging that it is “clearly provoking debate and is deeply unsettling for many people in the country, across different communities.” ‘only someone guilty asks for a pardon’ the opposition were quick to criticize the request from netanyahu who has faced accusations of stoking rifts within israeli society – against the arab population and the left in particular – as well as prolonging the war in gaza for his own political gain. yair lapid, the leader of israel’s opposition, urged herzog to reject the pardon request, at least in its current form. “you cannot grant netanyahu a pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse, and an immediate withdrawal from political life,” lapid said in a video statement. head of the left-wing democrats party yair golan said on x, “only someone guilty asks for a pardon. after eight years of trial, when the cases against him have not collapsed, netanyahu is now asking for a pardon.” but netanyahu’s political allies came out in favor of the pardon. far-right minister of national security itamar ben gvir supported the request, saying in a statement it is “critical for the security for the security of the state.” donald trump holds hands and speaks with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at the israeli parliament, the knesset, in october. saul loeb/getty images earlier this month, us president donald trump once again weighed in on the case with his own letter to israel’s president, asking for a pardon for arguably his most vocal international cheerleader. “i hereby call on you to fully pardon benjamin netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive war time prime minister, and is now leading israel into a time of peace,” trump wrote in a letter distributed by the israeli president’s spokesperson. a channel poll conducted in mid-november after trump’s letter to herzog suggested that % of the israeli public oppose an unconditional pardon, while % support it. the remaining % said they did not know. according to the israel democracy institute, the president’s pardon authority in israel is subject to his broad discretion. but, in general, pardons are only issued after an individual has already been convicted. “the possibility that the president might pardon someone before or during trial risks turning the president into an authority that bypasses the law-enforcement and judicial system,” wrote dana blander, a research fellow at the institute. “the rule is that the president acts as a ‘compassionate authority’ only after all other authorities have spoken.” netanyahu is the first incumbent prime minister in the history of israel to face criminal prosecution while in office. his trial began in may in three separate cases. in the most serious case he is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust for allegedly advancing regulatory benefits worth the equivalent of more than $ million at the time to his friend shaul elovitch, who was the controlling shareholder for the telecommunications company bezeq. in return, the prosecution claims, elovitch ensured positive coverage of the prime minister in an online news site he owned called walla! news. elovitch has denied the charges. netanyahu’s own testimony started in december but has been subject to repeated delays and cancellations, the majority of them at his request. given the remaining stages of the trial, which include testimony, judgment and potential appeals, the proceedings are expected to continue for several more years. there is no deadline for herzog to make a decision regarding a pardon. correction: this story has been updated to reflect that the pardon request letter was dated thursday but submitted on sunday.",Real

30,"reuters — fighting raged in eastern democratic republic of congo on friday, a day after us president donald trump hosted congolese and rwandan leaders in washington to sign new deals aimed at ending years of conflict in a region rich in minerals. congo’s president felix tshisekedi and rwanda’s paul kagame on thursday reaffirmed commitments to a us-brokered deal reached in june to stabilize the vast country and open the way for more western mining investment. “we’re settling a war that’s been going on for decades,” said trump, whose administration has intervened in a string of conflicts around the world to burnish his credentials as a peacemaker and advance us business interests. on the ground however, fierce fighting continued with the warring sides blaming one another. the rwandan-backed afc/m rebel group, which seized the two largest cities in eastern congo earlier this year and is not bound by the washington agreement, said forces loyal to the government were conducting widespread attacks. the group said in a statement that people were killed and several others wounded in bombardments that targeted towns in south kivu province in eastern democratic republic of congo. a congolese army spokesman said clashes were ongoing and rwandan forces were bombing. families flee clashes analysts say us diplomacy paused escalation of fighting in eastern congo but failed to resolve core issues, with neither congo nor rwanda fulfilling pledges made in the june agreement. videos shared online on friday showed dozens of displaced families fleeing on foot with their belongings and livestock near the town of luvungi in south kivu province in eastern congo. reuters was not immediately able to authenticate them. “numerous homes have been destroyed, and women as well as children have tragically lost their lives,” wrote lawrence kanyuka, the spokesperson for afc/m, which is not bound by the terms of any congo-rwanda agreement. forces loyal to the congolese government “continued their relentless attacks on densely populated areas of north kivu and south kivu, using fighter jets, drones and heavy artillery,” he wrote on x, without giving an overall casualty toll. a congo army spokesperson confirmed to reuters that clashes were ongoing friday along the kaziba, katogota and rurambo axis in the south kivu province. reagan mbuyi kalonji, army spokesperson for south kivu, told reuters the congolese army had only targeted fighters in the hills above kaziba and rurambo. “there is population displacement in luvungi due to rwandan defense force bombardment. they are bombing blindly,” he said. rwanda’s army and government spokespersons were not immediately available for comment. a senior afc/m official told reuters rebel forces had retaken the town of luberika and shot down a congolese army drone. he requested anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media. “the war continues on the ground and has no connection with the signing of the agreement that took place yesterday in washington,” he said. unicef on friday said it was alarmed by clashes on december and in south kivu, eastern democratic republic of congo, that hit three schools and another site near a school, reportedly killing at least seven children and injuring others. “in , fighting has intensified to levels not seen in years and children, as always, are bearing the brunt,” according to the statement. the un children’s agency called for an immediate halt to attacks on schools and other education facilities and urged all parties to the conflict to let children learn in safety.",Real
31,"family ties may become strained for former south african president jacob zuma after his eldest daughter accused her half-sister of deceiving men – half of whom are reportedly relatives – into fighting for russia in ukraine. the controversy highlights the growing recruitment of africans into russian military forces due to a shortage of russian recruits as well as the close ties between moscow and veterans of the african national congress. zuma previously belonged to the political party, which originated as a liberation movement that fought for democratic rule in south africa. zuma, , stepped down as president in in the wake of a series of corruption scandals and was expelled from the party he once led in . he received military training in the soviet union during apartheid, an institutionalized system of racial segregation that kept blacks and whites apart. who is zuma-sambudla, and what is she accused of? duduzile zuma-sambudla, , is one of nearly two dozen children of the former south african leader. she has been a strong supporter of russian president vladimir putin and has expressed admiration for him on social media. last week, zuma-sambudla resigned from her position in parliament, where she represented the umkhonto wesizwe party — led by her father — following a criminal complaint filed against her by her older half-sister, nkosazana zuma-mncube. this complaint came after the south african government began investigating how citizens became trapped in the war-torn donbas region of ukraine. the government was alerted to the men’s plight after they made distress calls asking to return home. authorities revealed last month that the men were “lured to join mercenary forces involved in the ukraine-russia war under the pretext of lucrative employment contracts.” zuma-mncube alleged that the actions of zuma-sambudla and two other individuals contributed to the men’s situation. zuma-sambudla has not publicly responded to the accusations. under south african law, it is illegal to serve in a foreign military without government approval. the democratic alliance, south africa’s second-largest political party, has also filed criminal charges against zuma-sambudla after discussions with the families of the trapped men. zuma-sambudla already faces separate charges of incitement to commit terrorism and public violence, according to prosecutors, for allegedly inciting violence on social media during riots that resulted in more than deaths following her father’s imprisonment for contempt of court charges in . zuma was released in . zuma-sambudla has pleaded not guilty to the charges. duduzile zuma-sambudla at durban high court in durban, south africa, on november . darren stewart/gallo images/getty images lawmaker chris hattingh, a democratic alliance spokesperson on defense and military veterans, shared his findings with the national broadcaster sabc. “i have been in contact with families, and everybody tells exactly the same story,” he said, explaining that the men “were totally misled” and “lured into russia for personal development” under the guise of “security training.” when they arrived in russia, hattingh continued, “their clothes and passports were allegedly burned, their phones were taken away gradually, and then finally, there’s no contact with them anymore.” in her defense, zuma-sambudla said she did not intend to recruit south africans to serve as mercenaries in the russia-ukraine conflict. in an affidavit presented to the police and referenced by the local newspaper, daily news, she stated that she had been misled by someone named “khoza,” who contacted her on whatsapp, claiming to be a south african citizen living in russia with connections to a “legitimate paramilitary training program” that did not involve combat. zuma-sambudla revealed that she enlisted and participated in the paramilitary training in russia for a month and was not exposed to any combat situations, according to the newspaper. she then recommended other people, including her relatives, to enroll in the program. of the people who initially traveled, south africans are now reportedly in north donetsk as part of russian forces. “based on my own experience, i believed that the program was lawful and safe. but i, too, was manipulated and used to create a false impression of legitimacy,” she was quoted as saying. zuma-sambudla reportedly assured that she would fully cooperate with authorities. the south african police announced that they are investigating whether “any criminality, including possible human trafficking, illegal recruitment, exploitation, or fraud, may have contributed to the movement of these individuals to the conflict zone.” cnn has requested comments from russia’s military and foreign ministry. in november, however, foreign ministry spokesperson maria zakharova stated at a press briefing that russia had no information about the south african nationals and had not yet received any communication from the south african government regarding the matter. “if there is a request of this kind from pretoria, we will be ready to consider it in accordance with the existing procedure in the spirit of relations of strategic partnership existing between russia and south africa,” she said. russian authorities have previously denied pressuring foreigners to enlist in its military. a recruitment scam or a murky maneuver by the kremlin? according to ukrainian foreign minister andrii sybiha, more than , citizens from african countries are fighting for russia in ukraine. “most of them are immediately sent to the so-called ‘meat assaults’ where they are quickly killed,” he stated last month. current information regarding russia’s personnel losses is limited, but western intelligence agencies estimate that the kremlin has suffered over million casualties, including more than , deaths, since its invasion of ukraine in february . the united kingdom’s defense ministry estimates that approximately , russian soldiers are killed or injured each day. five suspects appear at the kempton park magistrate's court for allegedly contravening the regulation of foreign military assistance act by planning to fight in russia's war in ukraine, in johannesburg, south africa, on december . oupa nkosi/reuters recent events in south africa mirror controversies in kenya, where authorities are working to secure the release of more than of its nationals involved in the russia-ukraine conflict. kenya’s foreign ministry has indicated that recruitment networks remain active in the east african country. last week, the star, a local newspaper, reported that a kenyan man was killed while fighting for russia in ukraine, only one month after arriving for a driving job. analysts suggest that the recruitment of african mercenaries to bolster russia’s military operations in ukraine involves not only the kremlin but also recruiters on social media who often mislead potential candidates about the nature of the job. those who reveal the job’s true nature advertise enticing offers, including quick visas, salaries up to $, per month, and free healthcare. paul mudau, a senior lecturer in public, constitutional and international law at the university of south africa, explained, “scammers handle the initial lure, often through ads on telegram or facebook for ‘jobs’ in russia.” however, he told cnn, “once recruits arrive, russian authorities detain them, force them to sign russian-language contracts, and deploy them with minimal training.”",Real
32,"the united states is reviewing its relationship with tanzania following a brutal crackdown on protesters after contested presidential elections in october, the us state department announced on thursday. united nations human rights experts have estimated that hundreds of people were shot dead while hundreds more were detained in the aftermath of the vote. “the government of tanzania’s ongoing repression of religious freedom and free speech, the presence of persistent obstacles to u.s. investment, and disturbing violence against civilians in the days leading up to and following tanzania’s october elections, required this reconsideration of our ties,” state department deputy spokesperson tommy pigott said in a statement. “these actions have put american citizens, tourists, and u.s. interests in tanzania at risk, and threatened to undermine the mutual prosperity and security that have defined our partnership for decades.” cnn has reached out to the tanzanian government for comment. the us statement comes after an exclusive cnn investigation found that police and armed men on patrol fatally shot unarmed protesters. geolocated videos, audio forensic analysis of the shots fired, and first-hand accounts from witnesses and victims, documented the brutality unleashed on young demonstrators following the re-election of president samia suluhu hassan – who claimed she won with % of the vote after barring her chief rivals from the race. additionally, satellite imagery, videos and eyewitness accounts pointed to the presence of mass graves north of the east african country’s main city of dar es salaam. following the contested vote, protests led by young people erupted across the country against the ruling chama cha mapinduzi party. hassan accused the demonstrators of being paid to overthrow her government. she has acknowledged there had been some casualties but no official figures have been released. the development also comes as meta confirmed in a statement to cnn that it had disabled or restricted social media accounts of two tanzanian activists who had been posting videos of post-election violence. meta said it locked maria sarungi-tsehai’s instagram account in tanzania following a legal order from the government. it also confirmed that mange kimambi was banned from instagram and whatsapp for repeatedly violating its rules on recidivism. both activists pushed back against the decision on x. kimambi said in a post that the move appeared “to be an attempt to justify actions taken after significant pressure from the tanzanian government to silence voices speaking on behalf of the people.”",Real
33,"nicolás maduro believes that his predecessor and political father, the late hugo chávez, appeared before him in the form of a small bird and a butterfly. he also thinks that celebrating christmas two months early – by presidential decree – helps “lift the spirits of venezuelans.” he confuses “gremlin” with “grinch,” invents words in spanish, and often makes one linguistic slip after another. the decisions and statements of venezuela’s president can be so eccentric that many venezuelans and latin americans have a name for them: “maduradas.” he has, however, proven for years that underestimating him can be a mistake for his critics. maduro greets the people after a vote on april , , in caracas, venezuela. gregorio marrero/latincontent/getty images mockery of maduro existed even before he took office as president of venezuela in , when he was just one among several potential successors to the cancer-stricken leader, despite having served as foreign minister and vice president. maduro received only minority support from followers of the united socialist party of venezuela (psuv), and his circle, according to reports, was in strong tension with supporters of the influential diosdado cabello, then president of the national assembly, for being the chosen one in a country dominated by uncertainty. but, overwhelmed by illness, at the beginning of december , chávez put an end to internal disputes and unequivocally blessed maduro to lead chavismo and venezuela. the “son of chávez” then inaugurated a government in which, year after year, he defied criticism of his electoral system, protests, sanctions, arrest warrants, possible rebellions, international isolation, and speculation about his future. the leader mocked by some is now the longest-serving president in power in latin america: years and seven months. maduro survived predictions and ridicule, but along the way, venezuela lost millions of inhabitants, % of its economy, democratic legitimacy in the eyes of much of the world, and many of its most important international allies. the venezuelan president says he now faces an “existential situation.” will he be able to defy predictions again and survive the military and diplomatic pressure from us president donald trump? the ‘son of chávez’ “if some unforeseen circumstance should arise that prevents me from continuing as president of venezuela, my firm opinion, as firm as the full moon, is that, in that scenario, which would require calling presidential elections, you should choose nicolás maduro,” said chávez in december , hours before traveling to cuba to continue his treatment. the president would return to caracas only to die, but the name of his heir was already clear. maduro himself says he does not know why chávez chose him among several candidates because he never aspired to “be president.” “but he was preparing me,” he said shortly after chávez’s death. venezuelan president hugo chavez gives his first press conference after winning national elections on october , , in caracas, venezuela. gregorio marrero/latincontent/getty images the son of a political activist from a traditional venezuelan party, maduro began preparing very early. as a student, he joined the socialist league and began working as a bus driver for the caracas metro. his activism made him a union leader, from where he jumped into politics. union and political activity allowed him to meet two decisive people in his life: cilia flores and chávez. flores was a young lawyer, and maduro was a rising union leader. she was one of chávez’s legal defenders over the coup attempt. flores and maduro visited him in yare prison. the path of love, politics, and loyalty began. flores became maduro’s partner and, eventually, the first woman to lead the national assembly and the person many today see as the “power behind the throne,” carmen arteaga, phd in political science and professor at simón bolívar university, told cnn. and he became the “son of chávez.” the mysteries of cuban support when chávez was elected president in , maduro entered the national assembly. as the then-president gained power inside and outside venezuela, maduro climbed the ranks, first in the national assembly and then in government as “a good second, always obedient,” ronal rodríguez, researcher at the venezuela observatory at colombia’s universidad del rosario, told cnn. “maduro was always an underestimated leader. there were many possible successors when chávez fell ill. but none achieved what he did: on one hand, cuban support, and on the other, distributing power within chavismo,” said rodríguez. maduro’s relationship with cuba spans decades and has various forms and mysteries. one of the few unauthorized biographies of maduro – “de verde a maduro: el sucesor de hugo chávez” (a play on words, since “maduro” also means ripe; “from green to maduro: the successor of hugo chávez”) – says that the current president may have been trained in revolutionary politics on the island during his youth. neither he nor official biographies mention this alleged experience. but maduro did build, first with the government of fidel and raúl castro, and later with miguel díaz-canel, a bond that is among the most important for today’s venezuela. and that, according to former officials of trump’s first administration, was decisive for the president to anticipate and contain, through cuban security services, the opposition uprising of april , among other things. maduro deepened his ties with the castros when he became chávez’s foreign minister in , and became a “key player” in , when the then-president fell ill and traveled to cuba for treatment. from then on, he was the key link in managing the strategic relationship between the castros and chavismo. that relationship helped maduro strengthen his position to be the successor to chávez, who had the charisma and influence that none of his potential heirs possessed. and also to oil a narrative first perfected by fidel castro and then by chávez himself – both leaders in the latin american left. it was an anti-imperialist and anti-us narrative, amplified by geopolitical alliances with historic us rivals. the start of the ever-returning cycle maduro leaned on that epic from the very start of his first administration. the “son of chávez” received his blessing, but not all his votes. in the april elections to choose the late president’s successor, the chavista candidate defeated opposition leader henrique capriles by just .% of the vote. six months earlier, in the october presidential elections, chávez had beaten capriles by a margin of .%. suspicious for years of the government’s electoral transparency, capriles and the opposition refused to accept the results. even chavismo itself, through cabello, showed maduro its dissatisfaction with the result and called for self-criticism. he responded that it was a “legal, fair, and constitutional” victory and celebrated chavismo’s continued rule. but there began the pattern that best defines the self-proclaimed defender of “popular and revolutionary democracy” to this day: contested elections, opposition in the streets, allegations of repression and persecution of dissent, and distribution of benefits within chavismo to avoid internal challenges and retain power. outside venezuela, the “maduro model” relied on the support and “know-how” of the traditional us adversaries: china, russia, and iran. from onward, all national elections were shrouded in doubts and controversies among the venezuelan opposition, international organizations, and even allied governments: the constitutional elections, the legislative elections, and the and presidential elections. the parliamentary elections were, in fact, won by the opposition, but chavismo used political maneuvers to neutralize that victory. time and again, elections were followed by opposition challenges and marches and, as documented by the united nations in its reports, repression and death. maduro defended these processes as “transparent” and his electoral system as “reliable.” he resisted, clenched his fist, and overcame challenges even when many thought he would not. this happened, more than ever, in , when not even colombia and brazil, governed by leftist presidents gustavo petro and lula da silva, recognized the results of the elections in which maduro supposedly defeated the opposition of edmundo gonzález urrutia and maría corina machado and achieved his second re-election. “the maduro case is an unusual case of regime survival in a region where, faced with similar challenges, other regimes fell,” says academic and amherst college professor javier corrales in his book “the rise of autocracy: how venezuela transitioned to authoritarianism.” the high cost for venezuelans for venezuelans, the price of maduro’s survival method was and is, however, high and measured in lives, exile, and poverty. since , several un agencies and the international criminal court (icc) have been tasked with enumerating that cost, sometimes even with the collaboration of the venezuelan government itself, in an attempt to ward off the specter of an international arrest warrant for maduro for crimes against humanity. year after year, reports described an increase in human rights violations, “coordinated in accordance with state policies and part of a course of conduct that is both widespread and systematic, thus constituting crimes against humanity,” as noted in a un mission report. “the mission found reasonable grounds to believe that authorities and security forces have planned and executed large-scale human rights violations since .” “the evidence obtained by the mission during this investigative cycle confirms that the crime of persecution based on political motives continues to be committed in venezuela, without any national authority showing willingness to prevent, prosecute, or punish the serious human rights violations that constitute this international crime,” concluded marta valiñas, rapporteur of the report. excessive force, arbitrary detentions of protesters and opposition leaders, sexual violence, torture, extrajudicial executions – all are present, according to un reports, in maduro’s manual for managing dissent. in response to each accusation or international investigation, maduro and his government resort, as they have from the beginning, to the well-known anti-imperialist narrative. “it is very concerning that the high commissioner gives in to the pressures of anti-venezuelan actors and makes biased and untruthful statements, presenting ideologized speculations as facts,” maduro’s government responded in to michelle bachelet, then un high commissioner for human rights. bachelet was chile’s first socialist president since the return of democracy to the country. maduro’s confrontation with bachelet, then a un diplomat, was a sign that the venezuelan government was also beginning to lose the support of the latin american left. poor management, war economy, exodus and sanctions the anti-us crusade narrative was also used by maduro and his government to justify venezuela’s dire economic numbers. these figures, typical of war economies in other countries, starkly expose the weak management of a maduro who managed to get venezuela to start growing only in , eight years after taking power. today, the venezuelan economy is % of what it was in , according to the imf. a man holds a grocery bag in front of a store displaying signs with dollar prices at the quinta crespo municipal market in caracas on november . federico parra/afp/afp via getty images behind this collapse is the decline of venezuela’s main source of income over the past years: oil. targeted by power struggles, chavista disputes, and lack of investment, pdvsa, the company that controls oil production and marketing, collapsed. the general fall in oil prices since did not help either. today, oil export revenues are just % of what they were in , according to opec+ data. maduro and his government blamed and continue to blame us sanctions for the economic collapse. but it was only in that the trump administration imposed sanctions on pdvsa; until then, the measures were aimed at punishing maduro and his officials individually. unlike in other countries, poor economic management did not alter maduro’s control over venezuela. but it did change the country’s makeup. overwhelmed by repression and poverty, which at its worst affected % of the population, millions of venezuelans chose to leave for destinations where the future seemed possible. venezuela’s exodus, along with syria’s, is among the largest displacement crises worldwide: nearly eight million venezuelans now live in other countries. the key to the ‘maduro model’ of survival maduro’s venezuela is a succession of crises that forced venezuelans into exile but, at the same time, strengthened the president, who blames sanctions for the exodus. “maduro is more skillful than most people think; he always knew how to take advantage of circumstances and turn crises around,” says rodríguez. to do this, maduro began building, as soon as his government started, a balance of power in which he became the guarantor. essential in this map were, from the start, the armed forces, a sector with which maduro had little relationship before being anointed by chávez. “someone once explained this to me: with chávez, the military thought they had to thank him for the prominence they had. with maduro, it’s the other way around. he has to thank the military and give them concessions like positions or entire economic sectors, so they tolerate him. he turned venezuela into a confederation in which he is the manager,” amherst college academic javier corrales told cnn. also key in this power-sharing scheme, which corrales compares to what the castros imposed in cuba, were the oldest chavista leaders, such as cabello or the now disgraced rafael ramírez, former president of pdvsa, among other positions, or tareck el-aissami, former vice president of the country. but, as in any closed power regime, some succumbed, under allegations of supposed corruption, and went into exile or ended up in prison. many others continued and today are not only part of the balance of power and economic management but also of international justice investigations into alleged crimes against humanity. maduro distributed power, money, and responsibilities and, in doing so, ensured his survival. in the “confederation” of actors that dominate maduro’s venezuela, paramilitary groups that, according to the un, participated in the cycle of opposition repression during the most intense social unrest of recent years, also play a central role. the “colectivos” are also a key tool in maduro’s balance of power and his future. “they are a highly armed sector. they are the regime’s sheriffs. and they have a lot to lose if the government falls,” says corrales. the intense relationship with the us former trump and biden officials share corrales’s assessment. there are so many legal and supposedly illegal actors involved in maduro’s government, so many interests at stake, that the president’s sudden departure could unleash chaos and an even worse drama than what has been corroding venezuela for years. almost thirteen years after chávez proclaimed him his chosen one, maduro faces another crisis, one that trump’s second administration hopes will be the last. with various tactics, the us policy of weakening maduro has, in recent years, been as intense as the venezuelan president’s anti-us rhetoric. it spanned several administrations and included economic sanctions, exorbitant arrest warrants, detention of relatives for alleged drug links, arrest and release of the alleged “front man,” granting and canceling oil licenses, direct dialogue and secret talks, and even a plan to allow free, fair, and transparent elections that led, in , to elections in which the opposition led by machado surprised the world. nothing worked, neither threats nor dialogue with a maduro who also proved to be an expert in stalling and delaying negotiations. the venezuelan leader now faces the largest us naval and air blockade deployed in the caribbean in decades. us and trump’s military pressure is growing, and maduro is once again trying to defy the odds. will he succeed?",Real
34,"tegucigalpa reuters — honduran presidential candidate salvador nasralla said last-minute interference from us president donald trump in the country’s closely fought election had damaged his chances of winning and left him trailing as vote counting dragged on. nasralla, a three-time presidential hopeful who describes himself as center-right, said in an interview with reuters that trump’s surprise endorsement last week of the conservative candidate nasry asfura had flipped the race. “it hurt me because i was winning by a much larger margin,” nasralla said at a hotel in downtown tegucigalpa, rejecting trump’s label of him as a “borderline communist.” the latest results released on thursday by the electoral authority showed nasralla narrowly trailing in the election, with .% of the vote to asfura’s .%, with around % of the ballots counted. that slim margin could easily flip. roughly % of ballots have “inconsistencies” and will be reviewed, according to honduras’s electoral authority. nasralla also criticized trump’s pardon on the eve of the election of former honduran president juan orlando hernandez, who was serving a -year jail term for drug trafficking in the united states. “i think he deserves punishment in honduras. i don’t know for how long, but he deserves punishment and the honduran justice system has to prosecute and punish him,” nasralla said. asfura’s conservative national party forged a close partnership with washington under hernandez, who governed from to and was arrested shortly after leaving office. trump has made no secret of his goal to forge a bloc of conservative allies in the region, stretching from nayib bukele in el salvador to javier milei in argentina. allegations of fraud amid disruptions in the counting of ballots from sunday’s election and allegations of fraud, nasralla has accused rivals of plotting to steal the election. nasralla said his suspicions of election tampering flared around : a.m. on thursday when his team reported the election website suddenly went dark. when it came back online, “everything had flipped,” he said. his narrow lead had vanished, leaving him slightly behind. “that suggests some algorithm changed that shouldn’t have,” he added, though he acknowledged he has no proof of wrongdoing. fraud allegations haunted honduras in the fiercely contested presidential election, with widespread accusations of manipulated vote tallies and irregularities. honduras’ election officials this week urged calm as they work to resolve complications with its rapid count system, technical issues affecting a web portal designed to display real-time results, and unannounced system maintenance. on monday, with asfura ahead in the vote count, trump hurled allegations of possible fraud without proof and said there will be “hell to pay” if results were changed. the organization of american states has so far not documented any manipulation and other experts chalked up the vote count delays to incompetence rather than fraud. “they all had a hand in building a pretty weak and broken electoral system and this is a byproduct of all that infighting that went on for weeks and months,” said eric olson, a senior policy advisor at the seattle international foundation and expert on honduran politics. “this process is not great but it happens all the time in the case of honduras.”",Real
35,"honduras’ former president juan orlando hernández thanked us president donald trump for pardoning his us drug trafficking conviction amid criticism from lawmakers that the pardon undermines the white house’s efforts to stop drug trafficking. “my profound gratitude goes to president (trump) for having the courage to defend justice at a moment when a weaponized system refused to acknowledge the truth,” hernández wrote on x wednesday. president of honduras from until , hernández was convicted and sentenced last year to years in prison and given an $ million fine by a us judge for drug trafficking offenses. hernández insisted he was innocent, claiming his trial was “rigged” and that it relied on the accusations of criminals who sought revenge against him. both republican and democratic members of congress have criticized trump’s decision to pardon someone with a drug trafficking conviction when his administration has been so focused on disrupting drug trafficking in latin america, ramping up military activity and launching controversial strikes on alleged drug boats in the caribbean. several lawmakers have pointed out the inconsistency in pardoning hernández while going after venezuelan president nicolás maduro, who is wanted in the us for similar charges. “why would we pardon this guy and then go after maduro for running drugs into the united states? lock up every drug runner! don’t understand why he is being pardoned,” gop sen. bill cassidy posted on x. gop rep. maria elvira salazar told cnn she felt trump’s announcement sent a mixed message and she “would have never done that.” trump, however, defended his decision to grant hernández clemency, telling reporters tuesday that he feels “pretty good about it.” “well, he was the president, and they had some drugs being sold in their country, and because he was the president, they went after him – that was a biden horrible witch hunt,” trump said. “a lot of people in honduras asked me to do that, and i did it.” prosecutors had accused hernández of conspiring with drug cartels during his tenure as they moved more than tons of cocaine through honduras toward the united states. in exchange, prosecutors said, hernández received millions of dollars in bribes that he used to fuel his rise in honduran politics. several people in trump’s orbit lobbied for hernández’s pardon, including his longtime ally roger stone. stone said he called on trump in june to pardon hernández, claiming the former honduran leader was targeted by the biden administration. though the white house is blaming biden for targeting hernández, hernández’s brother was prosecuted during trump’s first term by emil bove, who went on to become trump’s personal attorney. hernández has now been released from prison, according to his attorney. a us bureau of prisons database also shows that the former honduran president was released from a prison in west virginia. in his social media post wednesday, hernández promised the people of honduras that he would “continue defending everything we built together,” but didn’t say whether he has any plans to return to the country. he added that he would share more “soon.”",Real
36,"reuters — salvador nasralla, of the centrist liberal party, on tuesday took a razor-thin lead in honduras’ presidential election over nasry asfura, the conservative candidate backed by us president donald trump, in a vote count plagued by delays and allegations of fraud. the latest results released by the electoral authority around p.m. local ( p.m. et) showed nasralla on .% and asfura of the national party on .%, with around % of votes counted. the front runners were separated by just , votes. asfura had previously been leading by around votes when earlier results were released on monday. rixi moncada, of the ruling leftist libre party, was well behind in third place with .%. earlier tuesday, honduras’ electoral authority pleaded for calm as it scrambled to overcome a system failure that left about % of votes in the presidential election uncounted, as trump alleged possible fraud and swore “there will be hell to pay” if results are altered. on monday the electoral body said asfura and nasralla were in a “technical tie” with each holding just under % of the vote and that votes would have to be counted by hand. the initial rapid count system was beset by issues, the cne electoral authority said in a statement tuesday. that had also resulted in problems with the web portal where results were meant to be updated in real time. the website was down much of monday, causing tensions to rise in the tightly contested race, plagued by accusations of possible fraud before votes were even cast on sunday. as the count continues, former honduran president juan orlando hernandez of the national party was released from a us prison on monday, where he was serving a -year prison sentence for drug trafficking and firearms charges, a federal bureau of prisons registry showed. his release came after trump urged honduran voters to cast their ballots for the national party candidate, asfura, and said he would pardon hernandez. a white house official confirmed tuesday that trump had pardoned hernandez. conservative nasry asfura has fallen behind in the presidential election race despite support from trump who urged hondurans to cast votes for the national party candidate. marvin recinos/afp/getty images trump weighed in on monday in a social media post in which he alleged, without evidence, that honduras was “trying to change the results of their presidential election.” “if they do there will be hell to pay! the people of honduras voted in overwhelming numbers on november th,” trump said on his truth social platform. there was high voter turnout in sunday’s election, which was peaceful across the country, according to the organization of american states, which observed the vote. it said in a statement monday that it “was able to verify that the voting proceeded normally, except for isolated incidents in some municipalities of the country.” but there are concerns that if the vote count drags on, the highly charged election environment could lead to protests and possible violence. the electoral authority said it would now release information about the count directly to media and political parties to ensure the public was able to follow the results. former president manuel zelaya, who is also the husband of current president xiomara castro, lambasted trump’s interference in the election, saying on x that it was an attempt to stop moncada’s bid, and vowing the honduran people would stand up for democracy. “we who fight for liberty are on our feet,” he wrote. “we are patriots and nobody yields.” on monday evening, moncada said the elections were “still not lost” and alleged that the other parties had manipulated the process. she also denounced us interference in the election. both asfura and nasralla have said they may resume diplomatic relations with taiwan, which were severed in . such a move would mark the biggest diplomatic setback for china in the region for decades. in taipei on wednesday, taiwan foreign minister lin chia-lung told reporters that the island would actively engage with whoever was elected. “we also look forward to taiwan and honduras being able, after this election, to establish diplomatic relations based on equality and mutual benefit,” he said. in the election run-up, trump said he could work with asfura, a -year-old former mayor of tegucigalpa, to counter drug trafficking. he accused moncada of being a “communist,” without providing evidence. trump also called nasralla a “borderline communist” who was running to take votes away from asfura. the -year-old television presenter was vice president under castro before stepping aside to launch a third run for the presidency as the centrist liberal party candidate on a broad pledge to restore the rule of law and battle corruption.",Real
37,"islamabad, pakistan ap — pakistani troops and afghan forces exchanged fire late on friday along the two countries’ tense border but no casualties or damage were reported. each side blamed the other for triggering the clash in violation of a fragile ceasefire in place for the past two months. negotiations between kabul and islamabad aimed at easing border tensions and upholding the truce broke down in november but the ceasefire – brokered by qatar in october – has mostly held. the exchange came a day after pakistan said it would allow the united nations to send relief supplies into afghanistan through the chaman and torkham border crossings, which have been mostly closed for nearly two months amid escalating tensions. mohammad sadiq, a local pakistani police official, claimed the shooting started from the afghan side and that pakistani troops returned fire near the chaman border crossing, a key transit route. in kabul, the spokesman for the afghan taliban government, zabihullah mujahid, accused pakistan of initiating the exchange. “unfortunately, this evening, the pakistani side once again launched attacks on afghanistan in the spin boldak district of kandahar, forcing the forces of the islamic emirate to respond,” mujahid wrote on x. afghanistan’s ruling taliban refer to their administration as the islamic emirate. abidullah farooqi, a spokesman for the afghan border police, said the pakistani forces first lobbed a hand grenade into the spin boldak border area on the afghan side, prompting a response. he said afghanistan remains committed to the ceasefire. mosharraf zaidi, a spokesman for pakistani prime minister shehbaz sharif, said on x that earlier in the evening, the “afghan taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the chaman border.” he added that pakistani forces remain fully alert and committed to ensuring the country’s territorial integrity and the safety of its citizens. tensions spiked after deadly border clashes in october killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants, and wounded hundreds more on both sides. the violence erupted after explosions in kabul, the afghan capital, on october that the taliban government blamed on pakistan and vowed to avenge. the fighting was the worst between the neighbors in recent years. the qatar-mediated ceasefire eased the tensions somewhat but subsequent peace talks in istanbul failed to produce an agreement. pakistan has blamed most of the militant attacks inside the country on the pakistani taliban – also known are tehrik-e-taliban pakistan or ttp. though separate from the afghan taliban, the ttp is closely allied with it, and many of its fighters are believed to have taken refuge in afghanistan since the taliban seized power there in , further straining relations.",Real
38,"wellington, new zealand ap — a seal walked into a bar. or to use a technical term, it galumphed. the creature was apparently lost, curious and well below new zealand’s legal drinking age. it lodged itself under the dishwasher and showed no interest in calling a cab. it was a wet, lazy sunday evening when the baby fur seal waddled into the sprig + fern the meadows craft beer bar in richmond, at the top of new zealand’s south island. accustomed to seeing animals in the pet-friendly bar, co-owner bella evans assumed the visitor was a dog before she took a closer look. “everyone was in shock,” evans said. “oh my gosh. what do we do? what’s going on?” a patron grabbed a sweater and tried to usher the seal out of the back door. evading its pursuers, the creature dashed into a restroom and then hid under the dishwasher, which was swiftly unplugged. another customer fetched a dog crate from home, and evans made a plan to lure the unruly visitor out of its hiding place using a pizza topping the pub was offering as a special. “i just went to my fiancé, i said, grab the salmon! grab the salmon!” then it was a brief wait for conservation rangers to arrive. it turned out they were already tracking the wandering seal. “it was their fourth call for the day,” evans said. “they had been driving around this new-build subdivision trying to find this baby seal.” new zealand’s conservation agency confirmed it received “numerous” reports from the public about a seal spotted in richmond on sunday before the fugitive turned up at the pub. bar staff “did a great job keeping the seal safe” until rangers arrived, said department of conservation spokesperson helen otley. the seal was released on nearby rabbit island, considered a safe location because of its dog-free status, otley said. it’s not unusual for curious young seals to show up in unexpected places at this time of year, she added, as they follow rivers and streams up to km ( miles) inland. “they can turn up in unusual places, like this pub, but this is normal exploratory behavior,” otley said. successful conservation programs in new zealand have resulted in growing seal and sea lion populations, bringing them into closer contact with humans than before. scientists refer to an annual “silly season” for both species, a period of months during which they regularly appear in strange places – houses, golf courses or busy roads. evans, who has owned the pub with her partner for just a few months, said the baby fur seal was the first unruly patron she’s had to evict. but she said the animal, named fern by staff, was welcome back. “there’s been the running joke that we’ve got the seal of approval,” she said. salmon will remain on the menu.",Real
39,"ap — opium poppy cultivation in myanmar surged to its highest level in a decade this year as the nation engaged in a civil war remains one of the world’s primary suppliers of illicit drugs, according to a united nations survey. the growth solidifies myanmar’s position as the world’s main known source of illicit opium, especially following sharp declines in production in afghanistan after the ruling taliban imposed a ban following their takeover. the myanmar opium survey , issued wednesday by the united nations office on drugs and crime, found the area where opium is cultivated expanded by % from to , hectares (, acres), the largest area since . unodc also has described myanmar as the largest methamphetamine producer in the world. meth is easier to make on an industrial scale than labor-intensive opium and is distributed as tablets and crystal meth by land, sea and air around asia and the pacific. opium, which is processed into morphine and heroin, is harvested from poppy flowers and myanmar’s farmers have pushed deeper into harvesting as the country faces widespread poverty and instability during the country’s ongoing civil war that erupted after its army ousted the elected government of aung san suu kyi in february . a key driver of myanmar’s production growth has been surging opium prices. fresh opium now fetches about $ per kilogram, more than double the price of $. the opium economy in myanmar is worth about $ million to $. billion, which is roughly .% to .% of the country’s gdp, the report said. the increase in cultivated land helped offset a % dip in average yields caused by intensifying conflict in some areas, resulting in a % rise in opium production to about , metric tons (, tons), the report said. the increase also reversed a slight drop last year in cultivation and production and signaled an upswing in the country’s entrenched drug trade. myanmar already saw growth in cultivation and production from through , driven by the civil war, the report said. “myanmar stands at a critical moment,” said delphine schantz, unodc representative for southeast asia and the pacific. “this major expansion in cultivation shows the extent to which the opium economy has re-established itself over the past years — and points to potential further growth in the future.” there were emerging signs that heroin from myanmar is reaching markets in europe previously supplied by afghanistan, with several seizures over the past year that involved passengers travelling from southeast asia to europe. while volume wasn’t significant, it pointed to growing demand beyond the region to fill the gap left by afghanistan’s output collapse, the unodc survey said. “driven by the intensifying conflict, the need to survive and the lure of rising prices, (myanmar) farmers are drawn to poppy cultivation,” schantz said. “unless viable alternative livelihoods are created, the cycle of poverty and dependence on illicit cultivation will only deepen.” northeastern myanmar is part of the infamous “golden triangle,” where the borders of myanmar, laos and thailand meet. the production of opium and heroin historically flourished there, largely because of lawlessness in border areas where myanmar’s central government exercises only minimum control over various ethnic minority militias, some of them partners in the drug trade.",Real
40,"kuala lumpur, malaysia ap — malaysia’s transport ministry said wednesday that a private firm will resume a deep-sea hunt for malaysia airlines flight later this month, more than a decade after the jet vanished without a trace. the search will be carried out by texas-based marine robotics firm ocean infinity, which signed a new “no-find, no-fee” contract with malaysia’s government in march. it is unclear if the company has new evidence of the plane’s location. ocean infinity ceo oliver punkett reportedly said last year that the company had improved its technology since , when the firm made its first seabed search operation under a similar deal and found nothing. punkett has said the firm is working with many experts to analyze data and had narrowed the search area to the most likely site. earlier this year the firm restarted the seabed search operation at a new ,-square-kilometer (,-square-mile) site in the indian ocean after malaysia’s government gave it the greenlight, but the search was halted in april due to bad weather. ocean infinity will be paid $ million only if wreckage is discovered. the boeing plane disappeared from radar shortly after taking off on march , , carrying people, mostly chinese nationals, on a flight from malaysia’s capital, kuala lumpur, to beijing. satellite data showed the plane turned from its flight path and headed south to the far-southern indian ocean, where it is believed to have crashed. an expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues to its location, although debris washed ashore on the east african coast and indian ocean islands. apart from those small fragments, no bodies or wreckage have ever been found. malaysia’s transport ministry said in a brief statement wednesday that ocean infinity will search intermittently from dec. for a total of days, in targeted areas believed to have the highest likelihood of finding the missing aircraft. “the latest development underscores the government of malaysia’s commitment in providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,” it said. in beijing, chinese foreign ministry spokesperson lin jian said, “we … appreciate the efforts made by the malaysian side.” ocean infinity declined to comment on the search wednesday in response to an associated press email requesting details.",Real
41,"“it’s not a good airport at all,” president donald trump said of dulles international airport outside washington dc, at a cabinet meeting tuesday. “it’s a terrible airport.” he’s not alone in his assessment. operational for years, dulles regularly makes it on worst airport lists, largely due to one of its most unusual features: the people movers, more formally known as “mobile lounges,” used to ferry passengers between gates and planes. these cumbersome vehicles — a sort of giant bus elevated on hydraulics — became a talking point for the president’s cabinet meeting after a crash last month injured more than a dozen people. and now trump is vowing big changes. mobile lounges are not the only problem. transportation secretary sean duffy later called out the airport for its “jet fuel smell.” he’s announced that his department is inviting proposals and public-private partnership plans to construct new terminals and concourses there. it may have few modern fans, but the story of dulles’ design and evolution is an interesting one, explains bob van der linden, commercial aviation curator for the national air and space museum. “it’s the primary portal to the nation’s capital, especially overseas travelers,” van der linden said. “it’s extremely important. and of course, those big runways are wonderful for big airplanes.” the first american airport built for jets dulles was the first airport in the united states designed to handle the commercial jets. daniel slim/afp/getty images dulles was built because during world war ii, it became clear that washington national airport wasn’t able to accommodate the area’s growth in air traffic. the washington airport act of paved the way for work to begin, once a location had been chosen. “they were thinking about an area in burke, virginia, or taking over an air force base — that didn’t work,” van der linden said. “they settled on chantilly, virginia, which was quiet, open farmland.” president dwight d. eisenhower selected the vast ,-acre site in . then the name was chosen — in honor of john foster dulles, the secretary of state in eisenhower’s administration. it was built for the future. the airport was the first in the country designed to handle the commercial jets that were starting to dominate the air. massive runways were built in anticipation of faster, bigger aircraft as the supersonic age beckoned. despite this, the new airport gained a reputation as a “white elephant,” said van der linden. many claimed it a waste of taxpayer money because, since it was miles outside washington, dc, it was thought no one would use it. but success eventually came. thanks, according to an analysis from george mason university, to three factors. first, fairfax county, virginia, right on the airport’s doorstep, experienced significant commercial and residential growth over the years and dulles proved to be a convenient transport option for its expanding population. second, airline deregulation in allowed airlines to set up “hub and spoke” route networks, connecting large air hubs like dulles to smaller cities and drastically increasing air traffic. finally, airport expansion in saw the opening of a new midfield concourse terminal that increased capacity. for all its perceived faults, dulles has won plaudits for its aesthetics. eero saarinen, the architect who designed the sweeping, contemporary lines of its original terminal said he wanted to “find the soul” of the airport, according to the dulles website. he referred to it as “the best thing i have done.” sarrinen was praised by trump earlier this week as “one of the greatest architects in the world,” calling his efforts at dulles “a great building at a bad airport,” while teasing an “amazing plan” for the airport’s reimagining. the infamous people movers people movers, or mobile lounges, still transport some travelers at dulles. evelyn hockstein/reuters for many, dulles’ main flaw, said van der linden, is what made it original in the first place: it’s reliance on the people-moving mobile lounges. created by a partnership of chrysler and train makers budd company, they could accommodate about people. today they’re still in operation for international arrivals and air force flights. “the problem was, among many, was the airport was great when it opened in and fine throughout the ‘s, and then after deregulation, the traffic increased,” he said. “those mobile lounges just weren’t quite that useful anymore, and we needed ways to deal with it with increased traffic.” will it change? eero sarrinen was the architect of the sweeping, contemporary lines of dulles' original terminal. sha hanting/china news service/vcg/getty images over the last years, there’s been a major push by aviation officials to modernize dulles, van der linden said. but until now, little progress has been made. that could soon change if trump delivers on this week’s promise to “make it into as good as there is in the country.” “it’ll be exciting,” he added. dulles sudden elevation on trump’s to-do list comes after last month’s incident when a mobile lounge crashed into a concourse, injuring people. other incidents have happened in the past, including one involving a southwest airlines ramp agent who was killed in , according to the washington post. it’s unclear what trump or the department of transportation wants to change about the “terrible” airport. in early october, trump made an unplanned stop to dulles, which the white house said was for the president to assess “potential future projects.” the dot submitted a request this week for information in approaching the design, financing and construction of a new terminal. united airlines, which uses dulles as one of its hubs, released a statement in the wake of this week’s comments from the administration. “we look forward to working with president trump, secretary duffy, and faa administrator bedford to continue to enhance the airport’s infrastructure and operations in a meaningful and cost-effective way for the benefit of our customers and employees.” adding new facilities shouldn’t be technically challenging, according to van der linden. “dulles was built with an eye in the future back in ,” he said. it was built “so it could be expanded, because the land out there, there’s lots of it, and you can add runways to it, which is a problem most airports have these days. they need more runways.” correction: an earlier version of this story misspelled the name of dulles airport architect eero saarinen.",Real

44,"dubai — dubai has a new record-breaker on its skyline — almost by accident. the world’s tallest hotel, ciel tower, has officially opened, stacking meters of glass and ambition above dubai marina. its height was never planned — it grew unexpectedly as blueprints were torn up and redrawn. “we knew we wanted to build something spectacular,” says rob burns, ceo of project developer the first group. “but we certainly didn’t plan on building the tallest hotel in the world.” despite its record proportions, ciel’s creators were still forced to think small. the whole structure rises from a footprint of about , square meters, or about , square feet —a little smaller than a professional soccer pitch. not exactly tiny, but a tiny sliver in dubai terms. that meant the tower’s architect, yahya jan, needed to show constraint and rely on some clever tricks. ciel dubai marina meters the first group spend a little time walking through the building — as cnn did, with jan and burns — and you start to notice the tension running through the whole project. it’s a tower built for spectacle that keeps having to remember the size of its own footprint. almost everything inside ends up shaped by the tiny plot that launched this accidental record. the entrance, for example, is luxurious but not quite what you’d expect from a dubai record-breaker. you walk in anticipating something grand — large enough to host a convention or festooned with statues and water features. instead you get soft lighting, curved lines and the sense of a space designed by someone who appreciates how little there is of it. ’eye of the needle’ the building features a large void known as the ""eye of the needle,"" which helps it cope with high winds. ciel dubai “it was a very challenging project for us,” jan says. “it’s an irregularly shaped property. for a tower of this size the property could have been bigger. but i always say, you do your best work when you are challenged the most.” the lobby, in other words, is compact because it has to be. the grandeur is deferred upward, unveiled floor by floor, until the moment when the building finally has enough altitude to get dramatic. the rooms stick to this theme. they’re clean-lined, with neutral tones and smooth textures — modest compared to dubai’s typically sprawling resort suites, but the floor-to-ceiling views of the marina, palm jumeirah, and the gulf do some heavy lifting. with , rooms across its floors, however, the hotel enters a market already bursting with beds. burns is aware of the numbers. “i think a thousand rooms is definitely a challenge. and we knew that when we started,” he says. still, he insists they’re “very, very bullish on the hospitality market,” with plenty to set the hotel apart. like “-degree views, the wonderful rooms, the amenities, the facilities.” higher up, ciel’s signature flourish appears in the form of a void — something that jan calls the “eye of the needle” — that’s there for function as much as design. super-tall towers like ciel must make a deal with the elements. the higher the building, the stronger the wind blows. stand here even on a calm day and you can feel it funneling through the gap. “if you want the height that is great, but how can you shape the building to minimize the wind load? so, by having the cutout we let the wind go through the tower.” a dozen atria punctuate the height, spaced six to eight stories apart, filled with trees and plants. they’re both aesthetic and practical, offering daylight, cooling and giving guests a place to gather. vertical parks eye of the needle ciel dubai marina the first group/cnn what jan calls “social community spaces where people can come together,” will be used for yoga and fitness sessions, or as restaurant overspill areas. “we’re vertically creating small parks,” he says — breaking up the tower into “smaller neighborhoods.” they also help with cooling and energy use, using computer-controlled glass louvers to “bring the sea breeze in.” “future towers are going to be different than towers of years ago,” jan says. “they’re going to be porous, you’re going to bring nature into these towers.” perhaps the most dubai thing about ciel is that they didn’t set out to build a record-breaker, it just sort of happened. they kept adding amenities and the building kept rising because there was nowhere else to put them. it was jan that informed them that they were drifting into record territory as the design edged within range of previous title-holder gevora hotel, also in dubai, which stands at just over meters. “yahya came to us and notified us, ‘hey guys, you’re close to building the tallest hotel in the world,’” says burns. “and we said ‘wow, okay. let’s make that happen.’” vanishing into the sky the infinity pool on level vanished into the sky. ciel dubai ciel’s dining and pool spaces follow the same logic as the rest of the tower, making the most of what’s available. the hotel spreads eight restaurants across its upper floors, with the uk-based tattu brand occupying the most dramatic positions — the house of dragon on , the house of koi encircling the skypool on , and the house of phoenix perched in the skylounge on , where the -degree views do most of the decorative work. there are three pools, but the one that matters is the infinity pool on level , placed inside the tower’s wind-channeling void. it isn’t large, but it doesn’t need to be when the visual trick is that the water seems to vanish straight into the sky. ciel is not dubai’s most extravagant hotel. it doesn’t have the epic lobbies or the beachfront sprawl of the palm resorts. but it shows what can happen when a city, more used to living it large, decides to show some restraint. the public spaces are elegant without being excessive. the rooms are comfortable. and the views — especially from the upper floors and the sky pool — lend logic to the decision to build a -meter hotel such a relatively small patch of earth. ciel adds another shape to a skyline that rarely stays the same for long. whether it holds the world-record title long is unclear. dubai seems to see even its own superlatives as challenges.",Real

47,"editor’s note: featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘look of the week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. since sydney sweeney starred in a controversial american eagle ad this summer, which some viewers interpreted as promoting eugenics and white supremacy, it seems like the actor’s every move has been under public scrutiny in an effort to figure out where exactly she falls in the political divide. her press interviews go viral as onlookers attempt to read between the lines, and even her clothing choices are held to the light in search of evidence of her internal beliefs. no surprise perhaps, then, that an outfit she wore earlier this week on “the tonight show with jimmy fallon” has reignited passionate debate. dressed in a form-fitting maroon dress that finished just above her ankles and with a lacquered blonde bob that curved under her face, sweeney was quickly likened by many critics to a right-wing news anchor. the comments under the promotional x post from the tonight show’s official account speak for themselves, as observers made spirited comparisons to white house press secretary karoline leavitt, ivanka trump and former fox news host megyn kelly. similar comments appeared underneath an instagram picture of sweeney shared by her hairstylist. one outspoken content creator responded by making a video on the app berating the outfit, saying sweeney’s team were “doing this sh*t on purpose.” the reactions to sweeney’s look perhaps makes more sense when you consider the journey her public image has had lately. it seems like sweeney's every move — and every outfit — are under public scrutiny as onlookers attempt to ascertain for sure the actor's internal beliefs. todd owyoung/nbc/getty images her big break came in on the hit hbo show “euphoria,” where she garnered critical acclaim for her performance as complex teenager cassie howard. (hbo is owned by warner bros. discovery). since then, sweeney has appeared in the american tv series “the white lotus,” as well as award-winning independent film “reality” (), buzzy rom-com “anyone but you” (), and gritty sports drama “christy” (), which follows the life of history-making professional boxer christy martin and included a drastic hair and makeup transformation. her career has been called “one of the most promising within young hollywood” but controversy has never been far. in , photos of sweeney at a family birthday party where guests wearing maga-style caps went viral, raising eyebrows and soliciting questions about her own political leanings. “you guys this is wild,” she posted in response on x. “an innocent celebration for my mom’s milestone th birthday has turned into an absurd political statement, which was not the intention. please stop making assumptions.” in august this year, reports surfaced that sweeney had been a registered republican in the state of florida since june . but it was her american eagle ad that has garnered the most criticism for its perceived eugenicist rhetoric. sweeney didn’t initially address the uproar caused by the campaign, causing people to draw their own conclusions on how the actor felt about the ad. then in november, gq magazine published an on-camera interview asking sweeney about the fallout. sweeney responded saying she was surprised by the reaction but didn’t apologize, instead reiterating her love for jeans and her stance that she’s not there to tell people what to think. when asked if she wanted to set the record straight on her intention, the star replied with the now-viral soundbite: “i think that when i have an issue i want to speak about, people will hear.” her outfit worn on monday aligned in some ways to a broadly accepted definition of conservative dressing. according to marie claire, women in right-wing politics prefer “form-fitting skirt suits, sky-high stilettos, bouncy blow-dries and full coverage makeup” to achieve a look that is “hyper-feminine.” the new york times’ chief fashion critic vanessa friedman agreed, writing that femininity in the mar-a-lago community is played up “to an almost cartoonish degree” and that fashion is used primarily to “reinforce that proposition.” sweeney’s dress, which featured a cinched-waist and subtle shoulder padding, was a more mature choice than the mini-skirts and thigh-high boots she has been wearing lately. the dress was designed by alex perry, whose gowns have also been worn by ivanka trump as well as selena gomez, doja cat, jenna ortega, jennifer lopez and rihanna. whether it was a knowing wink to a discourse that feels never ending, or a coincidental fashion choice that was devoid of meaning, onlookers won’t know until sweeney speaks for herself. but she is in no rush to do so. in september, variety asked sweeney what her response is when she sees her name trending on the internet. she responded with a neutral expression and a collected tone: “i’m like, ‘oh, what for now?’”",Real
48,"in the medieval fantasy kingdom of migal bavel, where the film “ nights of hero” is set, characters speak modern english and wear trendy labels like cecilie bahnsen. directed by julia jackman and based on isabel greenberg’s graphic novel of the same name, the film even stars singer of the moment charli xcx. yet, it cultivates an inexplicably period vibe — despite such a period of time never existing at all. how did jackman do it? hats. some are silky, some are spikey, and some — like the one worn by stately maidservant hero, played by emma corrin — look like handkerchiefs delicately dropped from a great height onto the head of its wearer. the abundance and variety of hats on screen, from pilgrim to pillbox, is striking in comparison to today’s largely hat-less population. it harkens back to a time in history when socially correct headgear was as essential to public life as google maps is today. until the mid-s they were a sartorial identifier, able to delineate rank, status and wealth in one glance. despite a cast of distinctly modern actors, including nicholas galtizine and monroe, as well as an invented fantasy universe, coulthard's costume design feels eerily period — largely because of her use of hats. matt towers/ifc although the film is an adaptation, the idea to use millinery to help build the mythical court dress of migal bavel was costume designer susie coulthard’s idea. “it immediately just sprung to mind as i was reading the script,” she said in a video interview. “i just thought, ‘i know exactly how this should look.’” the cornerstone of her vision was a steven meisel photo shoot, published in the march issue of vogue italia. the editorial, named “organized robots,” features models such as gemma ward, coco rocha and missy rayder frolicing in tiered lace-trimmed frocks, aprons and quirky up-turned black and white bonnets like a fashionable group of amish women. working in part with hat makers adèle mildred and gabrielle djanogly of hood london, coulthard made bespoke hats for the film — including the three attempts it took to nail corrin’s maidservant hat — as well as another sourced from etsy, religious shops and professional costume stores. there’s the ominous, executioner-style black hoods adorned with miniature bird skulls for the film’s patriarchal overlords, the sinister beak brothers, or the biretta-style hats worn by the gold-masked guards, made by milliner zac dinnage. ifc maika monroe’s character cherry, a sensitive young noblewoman struggling to consummate her marriage to neglectful husband jerome (amir el-masry), wears two meisel-inspired bonnets. “what susie wanted with cherry was to show her chasteness,” said mildred in a video call, holding up a slightly devilish square-topped bonnet to the camera. (it’s a black version of monroe’s on-screen hat, which is available to buy from hood london). “there were several options on the table. and i particularly liked this piece because of the two horns on it,” she added. “because it shows that she has some agency, as well as being chaste.” the bonnet’s horns are part devious wink, belying cherry’s untapped sexual appetite, part nod to the pointed cones of a butterfly hennin — a style of hat worn by noblewomen of the s. “it hits a couple of points,” mildred said. “literally.” the fantasy genre gave coulthard an “easy” brief, allowing her to blend together designs from vastly different cultures and time periods however she liked. cherry’s second bonnet took cues from the milkmaids as depicted by dutch masters such as johannes vermeer, for example; while rosa, played by charli xcx, wears a tall, flower-adorned headpiece inspired by an ancient folk costume. as most components were fictional, there were “no guidelines,” said coulthard. “there doesn’t have to be any particular truth to it, as long as the character feels grounded enough, and the cast feel that they can act in what they’re wearing.” though, each piece was hand-stitched by djanogly and mildred to create a general sense of timelessness. monroe's pointed bonnet was inspired by a steven meisel shoot from , as well as the milkmaids depicted by dutch masters centuries ago. susie coulthard her two-horned hat was partly inspired by the butterfly hennin hats worn in the s. susie coulthard of course, the fancy millinery was a style choice first and foremost — but according to coulthard they made financial sense too, since hats, being so close to an actor’s face, get more screentime than any other element of dress. it was a valuable way of approaching the notoriously limited budget constraints of independent filmmaking. “it’s more impact for the money,” coulthard said. “i adore shoes and boots, but my assistants always say to me, ‘why are we spending money on boots that you will see for a nano second?’” but working with headgear also comes with its own complications. “putting hats on screen can be quite difficult,” said coulthard, noting the various head shapes to consider and ensuring cohesion between the headpieces and garments that had been made by an entirely different department. “you’d be surprised how hard it is to match whites,” mildred added. plus, some faces just aren’t built to be framed inside a cotton bonnet. “not everyone can get away with rocking those particular styles,” coulthard said. thankfully, all agreed this cast was up to the task. particularly monroe and corrin, who djanogly and mildred gave the milliner’s seal of approval: “they have hat heads.”",Real
49,"miami — a pack of robot quadrupeds trot around the floor, bearing the hyperrealistic silicone faces of tech billionaires and famous artists. one, with the uncanny head of elon musk, purses his lips as he circles around. just beside him, andy warhol and mark zuckerberg nearly collide. further back, pablo picasso takes a gentle rest on his haunches and stares off into space. occasionally, they each tip backwards and throw their heads back to expel a printed artwork from their rears while flashing “poop mode” from a screen on their backs. the half-humanoid-half-canine creatures look like something out of a cyberpunk game — or a fever dream. but they aren’t roving your nightmares (yet). instead they are on the floor of one of the wealthiest art fairs in the world, at art basel in miami. “we are not ready for the future,” the latest project from the artist beeple, titled “regular animals,” warns. on the first day of the art fair, beeple, real name mike winkelmann, stood inside of the pen, picking up the strewn artworks to offer them to onlookers. two of the robots are winkelmann’s own doppelganger, sporting his haircut and glasses among those resembling musk, warhol, zuckerberg, picasso and jeff bezos. robots in the likeness of andy warhol, left, and elon musk, right, are displayed at the installation titled ""regular animals"" by the artist beeple at art basel miami beach. lynne sladky/ap “i’m the odd one out, i’ll say that,” he said of his creations, smiling. the images generated by each robot capture what they are seeing, as they see it, each in a different style relevant to the person whose face they share. “they’re constantly taking pictures and reinterpreting the world through the lens of these different characters,” he explained. he showed different examples of the prints, which come in distinctive visual styles. “this one looks like an andy warhol, how he saw the world. the picasso image reinterprets the world as picasso saw it,” he said. as for the tech billionaires, he added: “we’re increasingly seeing the world through the lens of how they would like us to see it, because they control these very powerful algorithms. they judge what we see in the world and for many people, it’s their primary source of news. they have unilateral control over how we see the world, in many ways.” you may remember beeple from the height of the nft (nonfungible token) art frenzy in , when the artist stunned the market by selling a ,-image digital collage for $. million at christie’s. in the first nft sale ever at auction, he broke multiple market records and suddenly found himself the third most expensive living artist in the world, topped only by david hockney and jeff koons. the robots expel free nft souvenirs for visitors. sean zanni/patrick mcmullan/getty images since then, winkelmann has focused on growing his charleston, south carolina-based studio as a hub for experimental digital art, and has continued presenting work at major art institutions, most recently exhibiting work at the shed in new york and lacma in los angeles. he’s also added a hallucinatory stream of ai reaction art to the chaos of american politics, including an oval office portrait of new york city mayor-elect zohran mamdani sitting in us president donald trump’s lap while holding a framed poster of “wicked: for good.” nft art, meanwhile, followed its boom with a bust, which winkelmann called “inevitable” in a recent podcast, due to the amount of “dumb sh**” produced during that period, he explained. “i was the person the next day after the big sale being like, ‘mmm guys i hate to say it, i think this is a bubble,’” he told arttactic. but within the past year, digital art more broadly has entered a period of significant growth, per art basel’s industry report, and the art fair franchise has committed to the medium with its own dedicated section in miami, zero , which of course, is where the pooping robot dogs can be found. and, if you haven’t guessed it by now, the printed artworks are not just prints; they are in fact, nfts, perhaps fitting for how many times nfts have been called “bullsh**” on the internet. but — after the dust has settled on all the dead nft art circa — winkelmann believes there’s real innovation happening. on the first day of the fair, the zero section was buzzing, with “regular animals” drawing a crowd. spectators did double-takes at each of the faces and pulled out their phones to film the bizarre scene at hand. often overheard: “disgusting.” “disturbing.” also: “brilliant.” “that’s… different,” said one woman with a pause. at one point, two small (actual) dogs inexplicably on the art fair floor began barking at the robots. winkelmann allowed them into the pen and into the fray. visitors could get close to an elon musk edition on display by the pen. lynne sladky/ap “the reaction’s been pretty good, i’m not gonna lie,” he said. “i think it’s something where it’s very hard for you to walk past and be like, ‘okay, i’ve seen that.’ you’ve not seen that.” but, he added, he believes other artists will make work in this vein as we continue to question our relationships to intelligent technology, and those advancements continue to speed up. “i think it is something you will see more — this idea that sculptures are these living things that are dynamic and have more anthropomorphized features and we ascribe emotion to them,” he said. “i think it’s something you’re going to see increasingly in society as robots get more powerful.” these sculptures may not live to see the day, as they have a limited metaphorical lifespan. their primary function, to record pictures and store them on the blockchain, will cease after three years, winkelmann explained. it gives the creatures a more finite end, though they’ll keep their basic motor skills. by the first hour of the fair, each animal was already sold, the little zuckerbergs and musks and beeples ready to be rehomed.",Real

54,"new york — quilen blackwell, whose nonprofit transforms vacant lots on chicago’s south side into flower farms that employ at-risk young people to grow, arrange and sell the flowers, is the cnn hero of the year. online voters selected him from this year’s top cnn heroes, everyday people who are recognized for taking action to solve problems in their communities. reacting to the news, he gave credit to his wife, hannah, and his christian faith, as well as the young people who work at his social enterprise, southside blooms, whom he described as “stars.” “truth be told, i don’t know how to make a centerpiece. i don’t know how to make a bouquet,” he said. “they’re the ones who are leading the way.” blackwell, , never envisioned a career in farming or the floral business. he grew up comfortably middle-class in madison, wisconsin, and joined the peace corps after college, serving in rural thailand. when he moved to chicago for ministry school, he tutored students at a high school in englewood, on the south side. it was his first significant exposure to one of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods, opening his eyes to the challenges that his students faced. “i started to just realize, i could be any one of these kids,” he said. “they’re people who want a chance at something better.” he decided he wanted to help bring them more opportunities, and around that time, he also met hannah bonham, who shared his passion for this work. in , they married, bought a home in englewood, and launched their nonprofit, focused on finding environmentally sustainable ways to create jobs and alleviate poverty. growing opportunities for young people englewood was once a thriving commercial district, but as local industries declined over the years, so did the neighborhood’s fortunes. % of residents now live in poverty and the area is full of abandoned homes, boarded-up businesses and vacant lots where condemned businesses once stood. “most people will see the trash, the vacant lots,” blackwell said. “but for me, i see potential.” one of his early projects involved helping turn a vacant lot into a community garden. he quickly realized that growing food meant navigating issues like regulations, access to clean water, and toxins in the soil. while researching alternatives, blackwell was surprised to learn that the us spends billions on cut flowers each year – and that more than % of them are imported. “i said, ‘wait a minute. why are we importing flowers from other countries when we have all this land, all of this youth?” he said. “maybe flowers are the answer.’” today, their nonprofit has transformed six vacant lots into flower farms across the city, which grow flowers that are arranged and sold in their nonprofit shop, southside blooms. the social enterprise currently employs young people, primarily between the ages of and , and will open a second location on the city’s west side this spring. they hope to expand nationally. for blackwell, helping young people flourish is a lot like growing flowers. “as long as they’re getting all of the ingredients they need to be successful, there’s nothing that they can’t do,” he said. “our young people are blossoming and blooming every single day.” as cnn hero of the year, blackwell will receive $, to expand his work. he and the other top cnn heroes each receive a $, cash award along with

55,"after a lifetime spent reciting the eternal love story of the taj mahal, veteran tour guide vishu das says his faith is shattered. “the story we have been telling all these years – what if it turns out to be a lie?” he asks, distraught as he looks at the monument from a nearby rooftop. his desperation leads to a radical suggestion: “could we not just run a dna test on the taj mahal?” the moment ends with a bleak conclusion: “we are spreading a lie.” this is a scene from indian director tushar goel’s controversial film “the taj story,” released in october, which challenges the official history of one of the world’s most famous monuments to love. in the scene, das is advancing a theory widely debunked by historians: that the th-century taj mahal is not a muslim mausoleum, but a hindu palace, captured by islamic rulers and “repurposed” for their own use. “the taj story” is the latest in a slew of pseudo-historical films to emerge from india’s multibillion-dollar movie industry that critics say seek to demonize or erase the country’s roughly million muslims and create a history dominated by the hindu majority. those critics say the project mirrors the ideology of the ruling hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party (bjp), that has been accused of islamophobia and stoking tensions between the different faiths that coexist in the world’s largest democracy. paresh rawal, the actor who plays das in “the taj story,” is a former bjp lawmaker, although goel, the director, told cnn the movie was not financed or backed by any political party. the film’s narrative goes against the long-held findings of the government’s archaeological department and has failed to convince many in india’s media and academia. “the taj story” is a “collage of conspiracy theories,” wrote the indian express newspaper in a review, adding “it merely stirs the pot, blending fact and fiction to serve an agenda far removed from historical inquiry.” indian magazine the week said it failed both as “compelling cinema and a propaganda piece.” the movie opens with a two-minute disclaimer stating it is “a work of fiction” and that the makers “do not claim historical accuracy.” at the box office, the response has been lukewarm, with the film raking in about $ million from a budget of $. million, goel said. but for some, the narrative is resonating. “the truth cannot be kept hidden any longer,” bjp lawmaker ashwini upadhyay told local news agency ani. “if anyone tries to stop the movie, then more people will watch.” “it is about knowing the truth,” unnati, a cinemagoer who did not want to give her full name, told cnn as she left a screening in mumbai. “we have been misguided all this time. we never knew our own history.” cnn has contacted the bjp for response. a symbol of love rising from the banks of the yamuna river – sacred to india’s hindus – the white marble taj mahal is the th-century embodiment of an emperor’s love for his wife. commissioned by shah jahan in memory of his wife mumtaz mahal, the unesco world heritage site is india’s most visited monument, drawing over seven million people annually. within its gardens, couples seek inspiration from the love story it immortalizes. beyond its walls, its image has become a universal symbol of india itself, gracing everything from travel posters to wedding invitations. for generations, it has represented a story of devotion, unparalleled artistry, and the country’s pluralistic past. “the taj story” seeks to dismantle that narrative. the -minute courtroom drama centers on das, a tour guide played by veteran bollywood actor rawal. for years, das has regaled tourists with the legendary love story, but this public performance masks a deep-seated crisis: he is a man who can no longer believe the story he sells. his growing doubts prompt him to file a public interest litigation challenging the monument’s official history, thrusting the film into its central debate: was the taj mahal built by shah jahan, or was it a “repurposed” hindu palace, as a revisionist theory popular in some hindu nationalist circles claims? in the ensuing courtroom battle, the evidence-based arguments of historians and archaeologists are consistently drowned out by das’s fiery speeches, which decry supposed “leftist agendas” and the “over-romanticising” of mughal history. “this film is about the historical facts of the taj mahal,” goel told cnn. “why hasn’t it been taught in our textbooks?” he added the film is “not about hindus or muslims,” yet muslim characters are cast as antagonists – from a rival tour guide who opposes das’ campaign, to mobs that attack his children and vandalize his home. it’s a sentiment actor rawal agrees with. he told cnn that the film “doesn’t speak about any faith” and “speaks about facts.” he added: “we are talking about the education board and why the historians have played dirty and all that we are talking about… it’s all facts in front of me… and i have verified with one or two historians, good and honest historians.” rewriting the past the controversy surrounding “the taj story” comes alongside a broader attempt to redefine india’s past. since the bjp came to power in , critics say, there has been a steady push to rewrite history through official channels, particularly targeting india’s mughal period, when muslim sultanates ruled over what became one of the world’s wealthiest empires, until the arrival of european colonialism led to its eventual decline and collapse. textbooks have been rewritten to downplay the history of india’s islamic rulers, cities and streets with mughal-era names renamed, and muslim properties demolished by authorities for illegal encroachment on government land and as punishment for alleged rioting. “the taj story” narrative also carries echoes of the controversy surrounding the babri masjid in ayodhya, a mosque that was demolished by hindu hardliners in a attack over beliefs it was built on the site of a hindu temple. the building’s destruction sparked some of the worst violence india has seen since independence and has been at the heart of a fiery and divisive debate about identity and history in the ensuing decades. people on the day of judgement of ram mandir and babri masjid in ayodhya, india, on november , . pankaj nangia/india today group/getty images while supporters champion these changes as a restoration of india’s pre-islamic heritage, critics condemn them as a deliberate erasure of the country’s pluralistic history. it’s not the first time the taj mahal has become a flashpoint for political and historical disputes. in , it was conspicuously absent from a tourism booklet published by the hindu-nationalist government of uttar pradesh, the state it is located in. the omission of india’s most famous landmark sparked backlash, which officials dismissed by claiming the booklet was never intended for public distribution. five years later, a politician with the ruling bjp filed a court petition demanding that sealed rooms within the monument be opened to search for evidence of a hindu temple. the legal challenge was based on the long-debunked “tejo mahalaya” theory – a fringe claim popularized by right-wing author p.n. oak in the s that the mausoleum was originally a hindu temple. the archaeological survey of india has consistently rejected this theory, stating there is no evidence to support it. while “the taj story” does not explicitly endorse the tejo mahalaya theory, its promotional poster, which sparked controversy, depicts the hindu god shiva emerging from the tomb. historian swapna liddle said the period during which the taj mahal was built is “very well recorded.” she added: “the mughals were a very bureaucratic state. they left behind a lot of documents, and we have all this. this kind of a project was a huge project.” bollywood as a mirror for nearly a century, bollywood has held a mirror to indian society, the plotlines of the world’s most prolific movie industry reflecting the changing tides of a vast, developing nation. hindi cinema once reflected secular, democratic values championed by india’s founding fathers. but many critics say the industry has veered toward the right over the past decade – coinciding with the populist rule of prime minister narendra modi and his bjp. “the kashmir files” of and “the kerala story” of are previous high-profile movie releases that were criticized for vilifying muslims, perpetuating negative stereotypes, worsening religious tensions and distorting historical facts. meanwhile, films perceived as disrespecting hindu traditions have faced severe consequences. the film “annapoorani” () was pulled from netflix after right-wing groups protested its depiction of a brahmin woman – a member of the priestly hindu caste – cooking and eating meat. the historical epic “padmaavat” () triggered violent nationwide protests from hindu groups who alleged it distorted history by suggesting a romantic link between a revered hindu queen and an invading muslim sultan. an auto rickshaw moves past a banner of bollywood movie 'the kashmir files' installed outside a cinema hall in the old quarters of delhi, on march , . sajjad hussain/afp/getty images these films, historians argue, are part of a broader campaign to redefine india’s national identity by elevating its hindu heritage and vilifying its muslim past. historian liddle said that for many people, their “general idea of history” comes directly from popular culture. she said that even though these are “fictionalized accounts,” they have an outsized “impact and influence” because audiences sincerely believe them to be “actual history.” the taj mahal itself remains unchanged by the controversy. as it has done for centuries, the marble gleams across the yamuna river, a silent testament to symmetry and grace. but the story india tells about it is fracturing. “we are seeing a spate of movies that seem to be very consciously projecting historical muslim figures as villains,” liddle said. “this clearly aligns with a political agenda, and that is a kind of mischief that is very, very dangerous.”",Real
56,"spain, ireland, slovenia and the netherlands announced their withdrawals thursday from next year’s eurovision song contest after organizers decided that israel will be allowed to compete. organizers of the pop music spectacle, which draws millions of viewers globally, met earlier thursday to discuss israel’s participation, amid calls for the country to be excluded over the war in gaza and threats from some members to boycott. an independent united nations inquiry concluded in september that israel has committed genocide against palestinians in gaza and that the country’s top leaders have incited genocide. the israeli government has maintained it is conducting the war in gaza in self-defense and in accordance with international law, firmly denying accusations of genocide. members of the european broadcasting union (ebu), the primary organizer of the event, decided not to hold a vote on israel’s participation but said that “targeted changes” should be introduced to improve neutrality. israeli president isaac herzog said he was “pleased” with the ebu’s decision and thanked all those who “stood up for israel’s right to continue to contribute and compete at eurovision.” israeli foreign minister gideon saar said he was “ashamed” of the countries boycotting the contest. the eurovision meeting was held at the geneva headquarters of the ebu, a group of public broadcasters from countries, to consider new rules unveiled last month to limit governments and third parties from disproportionately influencing voting. in the talks, ebu members “backed a set of targeted changes to the eurovision song contest rules designed to reinforce trust, transparency and the neutrality of the event,” a statement from the union said. “this vote means that all ebu members who wish to participate in the eurovision song contest and agree to comply with the new rules are eligible to take part,” it added. several nations had expressed concerns over israel’s participation in the competition due to its war in gaza, sparked by hamas’ deadly october , , cross-border attack into southern israel. the conflict has killed more than , people, according to the hamas-run palestinian ministry of health. israel’s public broadcaster kan rejected the possible exclusion of israeli participants in the contest, to be held in may in vienna. its ceo, golan yochpaz, said at thursday’s meeting that the attempt by some to block israel from competing “can only be understood as a cultural boycott,” according to a statement from the broadcaster. if members had not agreed on the new safeguarding changes, a vote on israel’s participation could have been held, the ebu said. if a vote had been held, an absolute majority would have been required for an exclusion to pass. “a large majority of members agreed that there was no need for a further vote on participation and that the eurovision song contest should proceed as planned, with the additional safeguards in place,” the ebu statement said. last month, competition director martin green said the “neutrality and integrity of the eurovision song contest is of paramount importance to the ebu, its members and all our audiences. it is essential that the fairness of the contest is always protected.” he added that they were taking “clear and decisive steps to ensure the contest remains a celebration of music and unity.” decision triggers boycott from some countries the move to allow israel to remain in the competition prompted some countries to announce boycotts, with spanish public broadcaster rtve announcing spain’s “withdrawal” from the contest following the ebu decision. spain is one of the so-called big five who make the largest financial contributions to the contest. ireland’s national broadcaster rté confirmed in a statement that it “will not participate in or broadcast” the contest. dutch broadcaster avrotros said its decision not to participate followed “a careful process in which information was gathered from a wide range of stakeholders.” “avrotros concludes that participation under the current circumstances is incompatible with the public values that are essential to us,” it said. natalija gorščak, president of slovenia’s public broadcaster rtv slo, told cnn on thursday that the ceasefire agreement between israel and hamas is “not a real peace agreement because people are still dying.” if israel had decided to pull out of the contest and wait for “everything to settle down” before rejoining, she said, “there would be “no disputes,” and everyone would be “united by music.” meanwhile, broadcasters in france, britain, portugal and sweden committed their support to the ebu’s decision to permit israel’s participation in next year’s competition. french foreign minister jean-noël barrot confirmed france’s backing early friday, saying in a post on x, “france will never embark on the path of boycotting a people, its artists, or its intellectuals. everything in the soul and tradition of our country opposes this.” the bbc, which broadcasts eurovision in the uk, said in a statement, “we support the collective decision made by members of the ebu. this is about enforcing the rules of the ebu and being inclusive.” the eurovision song contest, which started in , is a famously eccentric festival in which artists from dozens of countries battle for the annual musical crown. last year’s contest was watched by million people, million more than the previous year, according to the ebu. it has sought to put music ahead of politics, but pro-palestinian demonstrators have protested at the last two contests in switzerland and sweden. this is not the first time world events have become a divisive issue for the competition. the ebu banished russia from participating following its full-scale invasion of ukraine in . other countries have supported israel’s inclusion in the event, including germany, another of the major contributors. “israel belongs in the eurovision song contest,” german minister of state for culture wolfram weimer previously told reuters. “there must be no esc without israel.” “eurovision is becoming a bit of a fractured event,” paul jordan, a eurovision expert who goes by the moniker dr. eurovision, told the associated press. “the slogan is ‘united by music,’” he added. “unfortunately it’s disunited through politics.” last week, austrian foreign minister beate meini-reisinger reiterated the contest’s long-standing claim to be a space of political neutrality. addressing the planned boycott of the th edition of the event in by a handful of nations, she insisted the contest was “not an instrument for sanctions” in a post on x and appealed to european partners to find ways to “improve the situation in israel and gaza” together. cnn’s lauren said-moorhouse, lauren kent, stephanie halasz, mick krever, niamh kennedy, joseph ataman, isa soares and tal shalev contributed to

57,"as vladimir putin stepped onto the tarmac in new delhi on thursday, he was enveloped in a warm hug by prime minister narendra modi – a signal that despite mounting international pressure, russia is not without formidable partners. after pausing briefly to watch a traditional dance performance, they got into the same car and departed together for a private dinner at modi’s residence. yet as he embraced putin, modi is attempting to maintain a deep strategic partnership with a key russian global rival: the united states. this is india’s diplomatic split screen. on one side: the potential purchase of advanced russian fighter jets, cheap oil, and an ironclad friendship forged in the cold war. on the other: american collaboration on technology, trade and investment – and the hope president donald trump will lift his punishing tariffs. in the wake of putin’s invasion of ukraine, india has leveraged its strategic assets – a massive market and a pivotal location in the indo-pacific – to command attention from both the white house and the kremlin. russia's president vladimir putin is welcomed by indian prime minister narendra modi at palam air force base in new delhi

thursday, putin’s flight was the most-tracked on the flight-monitoring website flightradar. but putin’s trip – his first to india since the start of his war – comes at a tense time for modi. new delhi is negotiating a much-needed trade deal with washington, after it was slapped with % tariffs – half of which was direct punishment for new delhi’s continued purchases of discounted russian oil. new delhi has recently made gestures to appease washington, cutting its purchases of russian oil and agreeing to buy . million metric tons of liquified petroleum gas from the us. yet, high on the agenda for putin’s visit are more defense deals with moscow – purchases of arms india deems vital to defending itself against pakistan and china, with whom border tensions have flared in recent years. indian and russian flags being installed along kartavya path for the upcoming visit of russian president vladimir putin on december , in new delhi, india. sonu mehta/hindustan times/getty images this underscores how india must navigate a complicated neighborhood: russia is also a close partner of china, while beijing is a major source of weapons for pakistan. in rolling out the red carpet for putin, new delhi is signaling to both the west and china that it “has options,” said kanti bajpai, a visiting professor of international relations at ashoka university. “it’s a sign that india is willing to stick with the russians” even though moscow faces widespread international condemnation, he said. “apart from the oil and the arms, it’s diplomatic hedging, showing beijing and washington that delhi has a third option and gives it a bit more bargaining room.” a ‘time-tested’ friendship india’s close ties with russia were forged during the cold war, when the newly independent nation was officially “non-aligned” but a recipient of much soviet industrial and economic aid as it charted its course as a new country. the tilt towards moscow, however, came in the s, driven by washington’s growing military and financial support to india’s arch-rival, pakistan. russia started providing arms to india, and moscow became a reliable counterweight, a role it has valued ever since. although india’s procurement of russian weapons has dropped over the last four years, moscow remains its top military supplier, according to the stockholm international peace research institute (sipri), a think tank that tracks global arms sales. indian air force personnel stand next to a sukhoi su- fighter jet during a joint exercise with the united states in kalaikunda, in india's west bengal state

but with whom india has longstanding border tensions. beijing, meanwhile, is a major arms supplier to india’s arch-rival pakistan, including of jets that pakistan’s military said it used to shoot down indian fighters during a brief border conflict earlier this year. one of those jets, according to pakistani officials, was a russian-made sukhoi su-. russian su- jets currently make up the majority of india’s fighter squadrons, according to reuters. this week’s talks with russia will likely cover a potential arms deal for its most advanced fighter, the su-, kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov told reporters tuesday. but in recent months, it’s new delhi’s economic ties with moscow that have been in the headlines – and have caused the biggest headache. when western sanctions over the invasion of ukraine caused the price of russian oil to plummet, india seized the opportunity. keen to secure a bargain to fuel its booming economy and support a population of over . billion, the nation significantly ramped up its purchases of russian crude, becoming one of the kremlin’s top buyers. in response to condemnation from the west, india consistently argued that its primary responsibility was to its own people and economy. but in august trump’s patience wore thin, and he imposed % tariffs on india – punishment for its trade deficit with washington but also its purchases of russian oil. then in october, trump announced us sanctions on two of russia’s largest oil companies, sending immediate ripples through offices in india, with trade and refining sources telling reuters that the country’s december oil imports are set to hit their lowest in at least three years. the mangalore refinery and petrochemicals limited refinery in mangaluru, india, on september , . abhishek chinnappa/getty images ahead of his arrival, putin questioned why india was targeted for its oil purchases when the us itself still does business with russia. “the united states itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants,” putin told india today in an interview that was aired thursday. “if the us has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn’t india have the same privilege? this question deserves thorough examination, and we stand ready to discuss it, including with president trump,” he said. the financial pressure from washington is not only straining ties but also appears to be accelerating a detente with beijing. days after trump’s india tariffs came into effect, modi made his first trip to china in seven years for a summit hosted by chinese leader xi jinping designed to showcase beijing as a global leader capable of providing a counterweight to western institutions. that same summit was also the last time modi and putin met. beaming for the cameras, the two exchanged a warm, firm handshake before retreating from the public eye and into the confines of the russian presidential limousine for a private, hour-long discussion. “i think people understand what india was trying to do there and thumb its nose a bit at the west,” ashoka university’s bajpai said. walking a tightrope trump’s first administration, as well as that of joe biden, saw india as a vital counterweight to china, and boosted strategic ties with new delhi through technology transfers and joint military drills. modi also shared a rapport with trump, a fellow right-wing populist with a flair for turning diplomatic relations into grand spectacles. the indian leader hosted the us president in his first term and cast aside diplomatic protocol to campaign for his counterpart’s second term during a rally in houston, titled “howdy modi!” in a sign that ties may be easing, india and the us recently agreed a new -year framework aimed at deepening industrial collaboration, technology, and intelligence sharing. us president donald trump and indian prime minister narendra modi in the oval office on february , in washington, dc. andrew harnik/getty images and new delhi is still negotiating the contours of a trade deal with washington, a deal its commerce secretary rajesh agarwal expects to be finalized by the end of this year, he said at an event last week. and on thursday a spokesperson for the office of the united states trade representative told cnn that a trade delegation led by deputy trade representative rick switzer plans to travel to india next week to continue talks on a trade agreement. from an indian perspective, however, such moves do not signal a break from its other partners. there is “no contradiction… in having an ambitious trade deal with the united states and having a working relationship with russia,” said nandan unnikrishnan, a distinguished fellow at the observer research foundation (orf) think tank in new delhi. this confidence is bolstered by an understanding within the kremlin, analysts say. “there is a close relationship between new delhi and moscow,” said bajpai. “putin knows that modi’s under considerable pressure there. he does have a domestic constituency to answer to, and he’s between a rock and a hard place.” still, this delicate balance will be under scrutiny from washington, particularly with major defense contracts on the table during putin’s visit to new delhi. “india will have to be careful to that extent, particularly since the bilateral trade deal has not been arrived at,” unnikrishnan said. “you don’t want to inject any more irritants into a difficult phase as it exists today.”",Real

59,"russian president vladimir putin said moscow would seize ukraine’s donbas region “by military or other means,” digging in on one of his key demands as ukrainian officials prepare for more peace talks that have yet to yield a deal. putin arrived in new delhi on thursday where he will be hosted by indian prime minister narendra modi, two days after a meeting at the kremlin with a us delegation led by special envoy steve witkoff. meanwhile, ukrainian officials are traveling to the us on thursday, where they have been invited to hold talks with their american counterparts on a plan to end moscow’s war, a ukrainian source with knowledge of the situation told cnn. ahead of the modi summit, putin gave an interview with india today, in which he said russia would “liberate donbas and novorossiya in any case – by military or other means,” according to russian state media tass. asked what would constitute a victory for russia in the war, putin said: “we will finish it when we achieve the goals set at the beginning of the special military operation, when we free these territories. that’s all.” one of the kremlin’s biggest demands is for ukraine to surrender territory in the donbas region, which russia has illegally annexed but not yet fully conquered. novorossiya, or new russia, is a historical term referring to territories toward the west during the russian empire; putin has revived the term, and used it in declaring the ukrainian peninsula of crimea as part of russia in . as russia doubles down on these territorial demands, which ukrainian officials continue to reject, the path towards any compromise seems increasingly unclear. despite putin’s bullish claims, russian forces would only seize the entire donetsk region in august at the current rate of their advance, an analysis by the institute for the study of war, a us-based conflict monitor, found. in putin’s description of his tuesday meeting in moscow with witkoff and us president donald trump’s son-in-law jared kushner, he said russia did not agree with some of the points of the us proposal, but that it was a “difficult task.” he reiterated russia’s demands that ukraine withdraw its troops from the donbas and “refrain from military action,” according to tass. the meeting lasted a long time as both parties had to “go through each point of the peace proposals,” putin added, according to tass. putin met with trump's special envoy steve witkoff and son-in-law jared kushner on tuesday. kristina kormilitsyna/reuters trump said wednesday the us delegation had a “very good meeting” with putin, and that they believed the russian president “would like to see the war ended” – though the talks failed to yield a breakthrough. “what comes out of that meeting?” he added. “i can’t tell you, because it does take two to tango.” both sides have remained coy about any progress they made in this latest round of negotiations, which have been ongoing since a -point plan drafted by the trump adminstration was leaked in late november. several points in that plan were widely seen as concessions to russia and contained ideas that had previously been rejected by ukraine and european officials. only small details from these meetings have been released, such as putin’s aide and foreign policy advisor yury ushakov acknowledging that they discussed territory in the meeting on tuesday, “without which we do not see a solution to the crisis.” he added that some points in the american proposals “look more or less acceptable,” while others “do not suit us.” ukrainian officials rustem umerov, the head of the country’s delegation, and andrii hnatov, kyiv’s chief of the general staff, are traveling to miami thursday for their own peace talks with the us. there, they will discuss the results of witkoff and kushner’s meeting in moscow, according to oleksandr bevz, advisor to the presidential chief of staff and a member of the negotiations team. “our task now is to obtain full information about what was said in russia, what other reasons putin found to prolong the war and put pressure on ukraine, on us, on our independence,” ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said in his nightly address on thursday. these talks comes four days after a previous high-level meeting between us and ukrainian officials that us secretary of state marco rubio described as “a very productive and useful session where … additional progress was made.”",Real
60,"reuters — russian president vladimir putin must have ordered the novichok nerve agent attack on russian double agent sergei skripal in , in a “reckless” display of power that led to the death of an innocent woman, a uk public inquiry concluded on thursday. skripal was found along with his daughter yulia slumped unconscious on a public bench in the southern english city of salisbury in march after novichok was applied to the front door handle of his nearby home. about four months later, mother-of-three dawn sturgess, , died from exposure to the poison after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which russian spies had used to smuggle the military-grade nerve agent into the country, the inquiry said. the skripals, and a police officer who went to skripal’s house, were left critically ill from its effects, but recovered. in his conclusions, the chair, former uk supreme court judge anthony hughes, said he was certain a team of gru military intelligence officers had attempted to murder skripal, who sold russian secrets to britain and moved there after a spy swap. “i have concluded that the operation to assassinate sergei skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by president putin,” hughes said in his report. “the evidence that this was a russian state attack is overwhelming.” russia has always denied any involvement, casting the accusations as anti-russian propaganda. the russian embassy in london did not respond immediately to a request for comment. hughes said the two russians who had smeared novichok on skripal’s door had discarded the bottle containing the poison without any regard to the danger it posed to innocent people. the inquiry was told the contaminated perfume bottle had contained enough poison to kill thousands of people. these “astonishingly reckless” actions meant the would-be assassins, their gru superiors and those who authorised the attack, up to putin himself, bore moral responsibility for sturgess’ death, hughes said. british police have already charged in absentia the three suspected members of the russian hit team. new sanctions on thursday the government announced new sanctions against the gru intelligence agency and summoned the russian ambassador over what it called moscow’s “ongoing campaign of hostile activity”. “the uk will always stand up to putin’s brutal regime and call out his murderous machine for what it is,” british prime minister keir starmer said in a statement. the salisbury incident triggered the biggest east-west diplomatic expulsions since the cold war, and relations between moscow and london have deteriorated still further since russia’s full-scale invasion of ukraine in february , with britain providing large amounts of military aid to kyiv. two of the russians accused by britain of carrying out the poisoning later appeared on russian tv to deny involvement, saying they had been innocent tourists visiting the city’s cathedral. all three have denied any involvement. hughes said russia had an “increased risk appetite,” citing the annexation of crimea and the downing of the malaysia airlines passenger jet, both in , and said the attack was expected to stand as a vivid demonstration of russian power. “the attack on sergei skripal by russia was not, it seems clear, designed simply as revenge against him, but amounted to a public statement, for both international and domestic consumption, that russia will act decisively in what it regards as its own interests,” the report said. although putin had previously denounced skripal as a traitor, the inquiry said there was nothing to suggest the double agent had been imminently at risk or that more could have been done to protect him. thursday’s report is the second major investigation to blame putin for attacks on british soil against his perceived enemies. an inquiry in concluded that putin had probably ordered the murder in london of alexander litvinenko, a russian dissident and former agent of the fsb security service, using radioactive polonium-.",Real
61,"london — andrew field recalls how his school in south london used to hand out a little blue book listing all the students enrolled that year. he says one boy used to go through the book to count how many children had the common english surname smith, and how many had the indian surname patel. “when there were more patels than smiths… he made a public ceremony of burning that school roll in protest,” field told cnn. that former student — remembered by field as a “pompous, isolated loner” who enjoyed “strutting about” in school uniform — grew up to become arguably the most influential politician in britain this century: right-wing populist nigel farage. after leaving a career trading commodities in london’s financial district, farage became a long-serving member of the european parliament before campaigning successfully for britain’s exit from the european union. but today’s -year-old farage, now leader of the anti-immigrant reform uk party, has set his sights on something bigger: if an election were held tomorrow, most polls suggest that he would stand a good chance of becoming the country’s next prime minister. field is among some of farage’s contemporaries at the elite dulwich college who have recently and publicly accused him of deeply offensive, racist and antisemitic behavior throughout his teenage years in the s and s. farage has denied the allegations, first reported on the record and at this scale by the guardian newspaper last month. but as more former students make fresh accusations, the scandal is threatening to stick to the typically teflon-coated farage. analysts say the allegations pose the biggest challenge yet to reform’s bid to convince britain that it is not just a protest-vote party, but one responsible enough to govern a multi-ethnic nation of around million people. field, a doctor with britain’s national health service, is not convinced. farage’s “burning the scroll” ritual is one of several alleged racist instances he recalls. he said he often saw farage giving nazi salutes and goose-stepping, adding, “those were really common sights.” a nine-year-old boy – the only black child in his year – was “recurrently picked on” by the much older farage, field claimed, “who would go to him and say, ‘africa is that way. why don’t you f**k off there?’” nigel farage attended the elite dulwich college in south london in the s and s. dan kitwood/getty images one incident sticks in field’s mind. when he was made a prefect – a senior student trusted to enforce school rules and act as a role model to others – he said that farage, already a prefect, took it on himself to show field how to make use of his new powers. “he guided me to lower school, where the younger children played, and he put an indian child in detention completely at random. there was no reason whatsoever for him doing that,” field said. “i was deeply shocked by that.” unlike field, who was two years younger than farage, peter ettedgui, now an award-winning film director, was in the same class as him from the ages of to . he said they sat in alphabetical order, meaning the future politician was never far away. “as soon as he found out i was jewish – that was it,” ettedgui told cnn. “he would say, ‘hitler was right,’ in a sneering, contemptuous way. in other words, ‘you shouldn’t be here.’” farage would also say “gas them,” ettedgui said, sometimes adding a long hiss to emulate the sound of a gas chamber. peter ettedgui, pictured at the th bfi london film festival in , said nigel farage would make antisemitic comments when they were at school together. jeff spicer/getty images farage has previously denied the allegations from field, ettedgui, and others first reported in the guardian. in a statement to cnn, farage said: “i can categorically say that the stories being told about me from years ago are not true.” richard tice, reform’s deputy leader, told the bbc on thursday that the allegations are “made-up twaddle” and accused ettedgui of lying, without providing evidence. claims of this kind were first made about farage more than a decade ago. in , the journalist michael crick reportedly uncovered a letter from an english teacher at dulwich college, where annual fees today can reach around $,, opposing a decision in to make the -year-old farage a prefect, on the grounds of his “publicly professed racist and neo-fascist views.” at the time, farage admitted saying “some ridiculous things… not necessarily racist things – it depends how you define it.” in response to the latest allegations, the usually forthright and forceful farage was at first uncharacteristically evasive, offering a cocktail of heavily caveated denials. “have i ever tried to take it out on any individual on the basis of where they’re from? no,” farage said last month in a broadcast interview in response to the new claims. asked what his comments meant, he told itv he had never abused anyone “with intent,” nor “directly really tried to go and hurt anybody.” he said the claims related to a period “ years ago,” when he had “just entered” his teens. in the later statement, farage categorically denied the allegations against him. if some thought farage was being evasive, many of his contemporaries say he is simply lying. field said farage’s racism was at its “most florid” when he was aged and and had been made a prefect – not just when he was in his early teens. “it’s when he had a little bit of power, and he was picking on much younger children,” field said. ettedgui also said farage’s claim never to have targeted anyone “directly” is untrue. “the abuse was directed and deeply personal. and it was venomous, which why i always remembered it,” he said. “whenever i hear the guy speak today, my blood turns cold.” farage, center, celebrates after being elected the member of parliament for clacton in eastern england, on july , . henry nicholls/afp/getty images it is unclear whether these allegations will dent farage’s hopes to enter downing street after the next election, which is not due until . sunder katwala, director of british future, a think tank in london that researches integration, immigration and race, noted that farage has routinely been able to win around % of the vote – some million people – in general and european elections, first when he led the uk independence party (ukip), and then for the brexit party, which became reform uk in . while his hardcore supporters might not be put off by claims that farage was allegedly a teenage bully who used racist slurs at school, turning reform from a “% party” to a “% party” – one that could potentially win a general election – means attracting a different, moderate kind of voter, katwala said. that task could be even more difficult against a concerted campaign of tactical voting, he said, if an “anyone but reform” coalition mobilizes to try to keep farage from power. although uk prime minister keir starmer’s labour party won a landslide election last year with just over a third of the vote, that victory was made possible by the “indifference” of most voters to a labour victory, katwala noted. “there’s more danger for them than they’d realized,” he said of reform. “if it’s not unthinkable that farage can win, if a third of the public think trying him as prime minister is a dice worth rolling, i think the majority of people need to be indifferent to letting people roll the dice in that way.” reform is not there yet, he added. although farage has tried to “detoxify” reform’s reputation, the latest polling from yougov in september found that a plurality of white british voters sees reform as a racist party with racist policies, by about % to % seeing the party as generally not racist. meanwhile, just % of ethnic minority voters have a favorable opinion of farage, while eight in see him negatively, according to yougov. farage, however, could benefit from the political distance he has maintained from what lies further to his right. he has refused to ally with tommy robinson, an extreme anti-islam activist championed by x owner elon musk. while much of the online right in britain is debating whether black and asian people are “really” british, and whether foreign-born politicians should be allowed in parliament, farage has long welcomed people from ethnic minorities into his party and proudly spotlighted them. “in a way, he’s on the mainstream side of those arguments,” katwala said. but farage’s former schoolmates say the public should be just as concerned by his denials as by the allegations themselves. “on the one hand, it’s actually almost funny that he’s trying to deny something that has been so widely corroborated,” said ettedgui. “but on the other hand, it’s deeply upsetting because this man could be the prime minister of the uk.” some former dulwich college pupils have told british media outlets that they do not recognize the allegations of racism levelled against farage. some of farage’s allies have accused his former classmates of a “political” attempt to smear him. but the accusers say they were approached independently of each other, with ettedgui saying he finally came forward because he wanted voters to do their “due diligence” before they vote in the next general election, due by . “we’re all saying exactly the same thing,” ettedgui said of the accusers. “certainly, for me, it boils down to something intensely personal: i don’t want my school bully to become my prime minister.”",Real
62,"a dark, diamond-like structure has risen on the banks of shanghai’s huangpu river. glittering by day and inky black after sunset, its glass facade evokes the angled geometry of a gemstone. but this sculptural form is neither rooted in nature nor even entirely designed by humans. it is — in part, at least — the work of artificial intelligence. the west bund convention center is a new showpiece venue in a once-industrial shanghai district now central to china’s push for ai supremacy. the west bund neighborhood already houses the aptly named ai tower skyscraper and a -million-square-foot “ai valley” expected to one day house tech enterprises worth a combined $ billion. so, when american architecture practice skidmore, owings & merrill (som) was commissioned to design a home there for the annual world artificial intelligence conference, one of the industry’s biggest events, it seemed only fitting to use ai. “we had the vision to actually use artificial intelligence as a primary driver for the expression of the building,” said design partner scott duncan on a video call from chicago, where the firm is headquartered. the venue hosted its first ai conference, while still under construction, in july and was completed in october. some of the hundreds of ai-generated proposals, each offering a subtly different solution to the design objectives laid out by the building's architects. som for both practical and ethical reasons, the architecture sector has, thus far, been conservative about ai-powered design. but som — which has designed some of china’s best-known skyscrapers, including the pagoda-inspired jin mao tower, also in shanghai — is among a growing number of practices using the technology to save time, reduce waste and solve complex design problems. instead of giving ai full creative license, the architects assign it very specific tasks, outlining fixed parameters and then leaving it to produce hundreds, even thousands, of possible solutions. for the west bund convention center’s facade, for example, the design team began by defining constraints that acted as “rules” for the ai — everything from site dimensions to the height of meeting rooms. the architects then developed algorithms around six key objectives: improving occupants’ views, maximizing floor space and increasing the amount of sunlight hitting the facade, among others. ai calculated the impact that adjustments to the exterior had on a variety of factors, including the conventions center's floor area and sun exposure. som such goals can (and often do) conflict with one another. changing the angle of a glass panel, for instance, might improve views but also reduce sun exposure. but through a process called “multi-objective optimization,” ai can analyze — to an almost infinite degree — the best possible compromises. “it’s like algebra,” said duncan. “you have multiple equations and multiple unknowns, and you can solve for them all at once.” leaving the algorithms to “think” overnight, the som architects awoke to hundreds of subtly different proposals, each one scored against their objectives. duncan estimates they were presented with more than iterations. “and we could have generated millions, if we had an unlimited time schedule.” narrowing down the options and picking a winner still required a human eye. after all, the designers wanted an “aesthetically pleasing” design, despite their many functional requirements, the architect explained. ""the algorithm doesn't know what beauty is,"" scott duncan on the design process : • source: cnn ""the algorithm doesn't know what beauty is,"" scott duncan on the design process : “we selected the one we thought was most beautiful and looked the most elegant in its setting. and that’s something that really can’t be automated,” he said, arguing that ai’s role will not replace human creativity. “the violin doesn’t play itself,” he said, adding: “the algorithm doesn’t know what beauty is.” art or science? som estimates that using ai for the west bund convention center saved weeks in design time and research. this kind of “parametric” design (whereby algorithms work within defined parameters) can also be used to improve buildings’ energy performance or reduce the amount of carbon-intensive concrete and steel required to build them. but the benefits extend far beyond efficiency, duncan argued, calling ai both “a time saver and a design enhancer.” algorithms can produce a degree of randomness on a scale that human architects simply can’t match, he added. “it has a level of precision that would have been hard to achieve at all if we were doing this manually.” the west bund convention center is part of a wider district — known as west bund ai valley — aimed at the rapidly developing ai sector. dave burk/som parametric design is just one way architects are employing ai technology. it can be — and is being — used in everything from idea generation to d simulations testing how structures perform in high winds. the london-based designers behind the world’s first “fully ai-driven” architectural project, a villa complex in slovenia, even asked artificial intelligence to analyze an image database of the region’s buildings to help generate ideas in keeping with the local heritage and style. yet, the profession at large remains tentative about ai’s adoption. a recent report by the american institute of architects (aia) found that although almost % architects were optimistic about ai, and around half have experimented with it, only % use it regularly for their jobs. a similar survey by the royal institute of british architects (riba) reported comparatively higher uptake in the uk, though the majority (%) still said their firms never use ai. the architects’ concerns were wide-ranging. riba’s members were worried about job losses and their work being imitated. nearly % of the aia’s respondents cited fear of inaccuracies and unintended consequences of ai outputs, as well as the question of “authenticity.” elsewhere, critics have suggested that the use of pre-existing datasets may reinforce biases or stifle innovation. the venue hosted the world artificial intelligence conference for the first time in july. lucas blair simpson/som some of these concerns speak to architecture’s role as both a science and an art. while few people would object to ai accelerating the discovery of new medicines, ai-generated paintings are far more likely to unsettle. (earlier this year, thousands of people signed an open letter calling on christie’s auction house to cancel a sale dedicated solely to ai art.) similarly, ai’s critics worry the technology threatens the character of building design and the human-centrism at the heart of architecture. wider adoption is seemingly inevitable, however. many of the d modeling programs architects rely on have already started integrating ai tools. since designing the west bund convention center, som — the firm behind buildings like chicago’s willis tower, new york’s one world trade center and dubai’s burj khalifa, as well as a soon-to-open new headquarters for chinese ecommerce giant alibaba, also in shanghai’s west bund district — has launched a proprietary in-house ai program, dubbed natalie, to assist with everything from facade shading (which dictates the amount of sunlight hitting a building’s exterior) to floor plans. “the user experience of a building incorporates millions of different factors and millions of different objectives,” duncan said. “so we’re really just limited by computing power at this point.”",Real

started calling for steel and aluminum scaffolds, in keeping with international norms, in the s. bamboo, however, remained the go-to material in hong kong, and has been used to build some of the

lightweight, customizable and relatively affordable, bamboo stands in stark contrast to its mainstream counterpart, metal. “steel is relatively stiff and strong, but it’s less flexible than bamboo,” said goman ho, a structural engineer at british engineering firm arup, who has more than three decades of experience overseeing the development of tall buildings in the city, including the -meter (-foot) tall cheung kong center. “bamboo on the other hand, has its own craftsmanship,” he added. “you can build a lot of beautiful scaffolding in ways you’d never think of.” ‘it’s culture we need to maintain’ whether in traditional or modern construction, handling the long poles requires specific skills and intuition, which can take months or years to achieve. “sometimes people spend one, two, three or even four years learning bamboo scaffolding and may not become masters,” said ho ping-tak (no relation), chairman of the hong kong and kowloon bamboo scaffolding workers union. “but with metal, the technical requirements are lower. if you have the strength, you can generally meet the requirements in a much shorter time.” arup's goman ho said that bamboo's lightweight and flexible properties make it best suited for wrapping around fragile, irregularly shaped facades. anthony kwan/getty images “bamboo is not unsafe,” ho ping-tak, the chairman of the workers’ union, said, emphasizing the importance of workers securely attaching themselves to bamboo structures. tyrone siu/reuters the largest member of the grass family, bamboo is combustible, susceptible to deterioration and weaker in rain, raising legitimate questions about its durability, arup’s ho said. “we need to find ways to overcome it,” he said of these challenges, suggesting that poles could be coated with epoxy or plastic solution to prevent erosion. “it’s culture we need to maintain,” ho added. but keeping the tradition alive is challenging. the industry comprises an aging workforce –– many, like -year-old leung siu wai, among the dozens of senior bamboo scaffold workers paying respects to lo pan, are close to retirement. new talent is also lacking, said ng. “it’s hard to get young people to enter,” he added. “young people in hong kong don’t want to do physically demanding work, or work that gives them an identity they feel uncomfortable with.” discussions on safeguarding the practice resurfaced earlier this year when the hong kong government’s development bureau announced that % of new public building projects erected from march onwards would need to use metal scaffolding to “better protect workers” and align with modern construction standards in “advanced cities.” the entrance to lo pan temple in kennedy town, hong kong on july , . noemi cassanelli/cnn leung sin wai, a

kong videographer in an instagram post that garnered over , likes. “truly one of hong kong’s quiet wonders. and soon, it’ll just be part of the past.” the storied building technique has also been celebrated on the global stage, presented as part of the hong kong pavilion at this year’s venice biennale –– the world’s largest architecture exhibition. in may, a sprawling bamboo scaffold was built

because we had planned for this without knowing (the government’s announcement) was coming,” said ying zhou, an architect and one of the curators. “so immediately, we were like, ‘oh what does our thing now say?’ it takes on a whole different kind of importance, especially when we bring it to a place like venice.” eleven bamboo “sifus,” or masters, traveled to venice to build the structure. watching them in action, zhou’s italian counterparts were, she said, impressed with the way the material was assembled so quickly and precisely –– without much calculation. “these pre-modern technologies are never recognized in a standardized world, because you have steel, you have concrete, you have numbers that are calculable,” she said. “and here we have something that even the

wraparound verandas, perhaps once host to evening nightcaps and slow sunday mornings, are barren. walls crumble, roofs collapse, and greenery reclaims them. for a decade, the new york-based photographer bryan sansivero has sought out forgotten, dilapidated homes across the united states — each with its own story to tell. inside deserted clapboard farmsteads, palatial antebellum-era plantation houses and maximalist queen anne-style structures, sansivero has discovered many residences that were never emptied, offering a portal into another life. musty libraries are filled with books, papers and photographs; in one, a nearby coffee mug sits unretrieved. grand pianos and half-full liquor bottles collect dust, while colorful children’s playrooms scattered with toys are unsettlingly idle. the images come together in his latest book, “america the abandoned: captivating portraits of deserted homes.” “it’s about capturing these time capsules; these lost places,” he explained in a phone call. “i like the mystery of not knowing what you’re going to find.” a soapstone victorian house in albemarle county, virginia. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned the rainer-lewis house in bullock county, alabama. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned a queen anne home in chester county, south carolina. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned a crooked home in aroostook county, maine. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned sansivero has documented abandoned spaces since he was a film studies major in college, starting out with the kings park psychiatric center, a disused psychiatric hospital in long island that served as the setting for his documentary thesis. over time, he found himself drawn to private residences — millions of which are abandoned across the country — especially as urban exploration, or “urbex,” became a highly monetized form of social media content that has become what he likens to a competitive sport. abandoned hospitals, churches and schools are easy to find; houses, on the other hand, have a sense of discovery. “if you go viral, you can get two million likes and hundreds of thousands of followers, and people are trying to chase that,” he said, saying it becomes about “the most views, the biggest and the best and all of that.” instead, sansivero has reacted in opposition, opting for the slow and deliberate methodology of medium-format film — though he does still post his images to more than , followers on instagram. “for me, i’ve just been going backwards. i want to shoot more film. i want to shoot less digital, with an emphasis on using older, unique equipment.” a hunting enthusiast lived in this taxidermy-filled home in the catskills area of new york, according to sansivero, and likely until their last days. upstairs, the photographer found a hospital bed and medical equipment. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned the furniture and wood paneled walls of this home in central georgia, gave a distinct mid-century feel, but sansivero said each room felt like a different time period. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned in one property, old dollhouses lie in eerie decay. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned that doesn’t mean the homes sansivero finds have been untouched since they were inhabited. many have been destroyed or vandalized, perhaps by squatters, teenagers or the urbex set. occasionally, he’s gotten a tip on a house only to find it filled by other photographers and content creators racing to be there first. but often, he finds houses by chance, or with help from google earth, taking weeklong trips to the south or midwest to areas impacted by the loss of industry or other economic or environmental pressures. his treks come with risks — he’s inhaled mold (and now carries masks), his leg has gone through a decaying floor, and he’s felt the uneasy sway of a home seemingly near collapse. yet he’s been undeterred, drawn to dramatic architecture and eccentric or historical collections, such as a room stacked high with vintage dollhouses, mannequins populating a house like ghosts, or interiors still decorated for a christmas of the distant past. “i can find a dozen or more houses exploring in a day and not want to photograph anything, because it’s an empty shell or it’s been trashed — it’s not telling a story about the previous owner,” he said. “i’m interested in what happened, why it was left like this.” books stacked high in the former home of an unnamed pulitzer prize-winning author in preston county, west virginia. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned sansivero alluded to a “turbulent” backstory to this house in northeastern maryland, which had the remnants of a horse collection in a child’s room. at the time he photographed it, sansivero said that exterior signs pointed to its imminent demolition. © bryan sansivero, excerpted from america the abandoned sansivero researches the houses he photographs to whatever extent he can, but in “america the abandoned,” he shares limited details, giving a sense of who lived there but anonymizing them, avoiding social media’s instinct to exploit or exhaust a tragic story. among the homes he has discovered are former respective residences of a local politician, an important fashion and textile designer, and a pulitzer-prize winning author. in one house, filled with life-sized mannequin mermaids, he found a disturbing published account that told the tale of a serial killer with victims in the basement, he recounted. the mermaids’ origins remain unknown. the photographer found that former residence by chance when he was with a friend on the road; the boarded-up brick property by the highway was unmissable. “we were just driving down the highway, and i was like, ‘oh, look at that house.’” lately, sansivero has set his sights overseas, exploring chateaus and castles in europe whose histories can stretch back much further in time. “america the abandoned” may be a cap on a decade-long exploration of us homes, but it’s likely more a pause than an end to the work. after all, as sansivero noted, with time, there will always be more to discover. images: excerpted from “america the abandoned: captivating portraits of deserted homes” © bryan sansivero. used with permission from artisan. all rights reserved.",Real
66,"when róisín heneghan received a phone call years ago announcing that her four-person architecture firm had been chosen to design one of the world’s largest museums, she thought it was a prank. she called the official back to ensure it wasn’t some elaborate ruse. “it was unreal,” she recalled in a video interview from dublin, ireland, where she runs heneghan peng architects alongside husband shih-fu peng. “we got the call, and i put down the phone — because in those days, it was all by phone or by letters and post — and i said, ‘i think we won.’” eighteen months earlier, in , egypt’s government had launched an international design competition for its grand egyptian museum, a vast complex expected to house , ancient artifacts a stone’s throw from the pyramids of giza. what was even more surprising than a little-known irish firm’s proposal being chosen from , entries, is that it would take more than two decades — and a budget that ballooned to well in excess of $ billion — for heneghan and peng’s vision to be realized. on saturday, egypt’s showpiece museum officially opens its doors after innumerable interruptions, delays and setbacks. it is a project of such significance to the country’s tourism-centric economy that the government has declared a public holiday to mark its inauguration. the grand egyptian museum georges & samuel mohsen first announced in , plans have endured egypt’s arab spring-era revolution in and a military coup d’état two years later. in , cnn optimistically included the museum in its list of the “world’s most anticipated buildings completing in ,” before the covid- pandemic put paid to hopes of an imminent opening. described in the architects’ press release as “a testament to the longevity and scale of ancient egyptian civilization,” the museum also reflects the patience of its designers. (by comparison, the centre pompidou in paris opened just six years after the winner of its design competition was announced in .) heneghan said she last visited the museum, which was then still being built, a “few years ago.” she will not be in attendance at saturday’s inauguration and, having been given no supervisory role during construction, the firm sometimes relied on photographs and google earth to check on the building’s progress. the pyramids of giza are visible from the museum. georges & samuel mohsen “in egypt, and in many projects in that region, a lot of the time the supervision teams are completely different from the design team — and that was the process here,” she offered as explanation. heneghan also said there have been some changes to the original design, but that this “is to be expected” for a building of this scale. for the -year-old architect, who was in her late s when the competition was announced, seeing the project come to fruition has, nonetheless, been worth the wait. “big projects are complicated,” she said diplomatically, when asked about the successive delays. “this is a big museum, and they’re moving very, very sensitive pieces in. so, if it takes a little longer and do it properly, i think it’s worthwhile.” papyrus scrolls, textiles, sarcophagi, pottery and mummified human remains are among the museum's vast collection. georges & samuel mohsen among these fragile artifacts are millennia-old papyrus scrolls, textiles, sarcophagi, pottery and mummified human remains. they are set across more than , square feet of permanent exhibition space, making it the world’s largest museum dedicated to a single civilization. galleries are organized by historical period, from the predynastic period through to the coptic era — or from about bc to the th century ad. a tutankhamun gallery, meanwhile, displays , items found in the young king’s tomb. “we wanted visitors to appreciate the scale of the collection,” heneghan said of her original vision for the design. outside, manicured gardens and an open plaza (complete with an -ton obelisk) welcome visitors to the site. the museum experience begins, however, in a soaring atrium, where a -foot-tall statue of ramesses ii stands solemnly on guard. the angular, pyramidal motifs employed on the building’s facade — expressed in concrete, glass and locally sourced limestone — carry through to this grand internal courtyard. roof folds allow a generous amount of light into the space — it is a luxury afforded by the fact that stone artifacts are less vulnerable to sun exposure than organic ones like paintings, for instance. breaking from museum orthodoxy, heneghan felt that natural daylight would “create a better ambience, rather than always being in an artificially lit space.” architect heneghan wanted to incorporate natural light into the museum's space. georges & samuel mohsen vast statues welcome visitors to the museum. georges & samuel mohsen the functional centerpiece is a six-story staircase, which leads museumgoers past stone monuments and pharaonic statues arranged in reverse chronological order. at its summit lies the greatest artwork of them all: a direct and unobstructed view of the giza pyramid complex, just over a mile away. designing a landmark beside one of the seven wonders of the ancient world would have been a daunting task for any architect. heneghan and peng’s approach was one of visual deference. this was partly a matter of geometry: the slope of the museum’s roof points directly at the tallest point of the great pyramid — but no higher, so that the building, despite its hulking size, does not encroach on or overshadow its neighbor’s profile. viewed from above, the museum’s volumes fan out like a wide-lensed telescope, the lines of its walls mathematically aligned to the vista it serves. elsewhere, storage and conservation facilities, including laboratories, are hidden further back, connected to the museum via a tunnel. “we spoke about it as creating a new ‘edge’ to the desert plateau,” heneghan said, describing the challenge of respecting the surroundings while designing at scale. “it was always a balance. it’s a very large and very significant building.” the trick, she said, was giving the museum “the prominence it demands” but only in “the horizontal,” not the vertical — in other words, without impeding the skyline. aerial view of the grand egyptian museum grand egyptian museum it was, perhaps, this lack of architectural ego that saw heneghan and peng’s scheme triumph over entries from more than countries back in . and although winning the commission, just four years after establishing their practice, supercharged the pair’s public profile (“for us, it opened up a whole world of possibilities,” heneghan said, adding: “people knew who we were because of the museum”) they have remained committed to thoughtful and understated design. but much else has changed for the pair in the decades since that fateful phone call. their firm has opened an office in berlin, and they now employ people working across commercial, residential, educational and civic projects. they have produced other major works of cultural architecture, from west bank’s palestinian museum to the giant’s causeway visitors’ centre in northern ireland. yet, heneghan stands by the early-career design that she — and her firm — may always be best known for. if asked to design egypt’s most prestigious museum from scratch, today, she wouldn’t do too much differently, she said. “our approach would still be very similar,” heneghan added. “i think the underlying structure of the project is very strong, and i think it stands up over the years.”",Real

72,"apple for decades has been known for a consistent string of design-forward, tech-defining consumer products that have shaped how people use technology. now the company known for its steadiness is going through a shakeup at the top, as both apple and the tech industry at large are at a crossroads. apple announced the departures of three executive team members in less than a week. meta poached a key apple design leader. and speculation is mounting that tim cook may be preparing to step aside as ceo. the changes come as critics say apple, once a tech leader, is behind in the next big wave: artificial intelligence. for one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, a change in leadership could mean a change in how it conceives, designs and creates products used around the world every single day. “the only thing we can read into this is that we’re headed to a time of increased volatility for apple,” said robert siegel, a longtime venture capitalist and lecturer at stanford’s graduate school of business. apple stock (aapl) is up roughly % this year, a much smaller jump than the % increase it saw in . apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. who’s leaving and why planned departures for the following apple executives were announced just this week: lisa jackson, apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, is set to retire next year. general counsel kate adams, also set to retire next year. alan dye, vice president of human interface design, who is joining meta as its chief design officer. john giannandrea, senior vice president of machine learning and ai strategy, who will also retire next year. apple is bringing in meta chief legal officer jennifer newstead to lead government affairs after adams retires and serve as its new general counsel. the environment and social initiatives teams will now report to sabih khan, apple’s chief operating officer. amar subramanya, microsoft’s corporate vice president of ai, will be apple’s new vice president of ai. and earlier this year, jeff williams stepped back from his role as apple’s chief operating officer. apple park, apple's circular hq office building, is seen

away from its metaverse virtual reality project and towards ai glasses and wearables. amazon laid off , people in october as part of a push to move faster in ai by operating more leanly. and google last year combined its hardware and software teams to better integrate ai into its products across the board. but apple is known for having a uniquely tight-knit company culture driven by secrecy. “this is against the typical culture of apple. but they need to rip the band-aid off,” said dan ives, global head of tech research for wedbush securities. “because the ai strategy has been invisible, and it’s going to define cook’s legacy, how he handles this chapter.” apple’s future and challenges the leadership shakeup comes as questions about apple’s future loom. apple delayed a major update to its siri voice assistant that was expected to bring it closer to openai’s chatgpt and google’s gemini, turning siri from a question-and-answer machine into an assistant that can act on a user’s behalf and incorporate information from a person’s phone to personalize responses. but that upgrade has been pushed off until next year, and apple’s other ai updates for iphones, macs and ipads have been minimal this year. and apple’s expensive vision pro headset, the first new computing category the company has introduced since the decade-old apple watch, is still a niche product. at the same time, meta, google, samsung and openai have announced significant product expansions in ai this year – from meta’s new ray-ban display smart glasses to google and samsung’s gemini-powered headset and openai’s push into shopping and web browsers. google’s gemini model has also been making waves since its november launch. customers try the apple vision pro mixed reality glasses device by us company

former design chief jony ive, is joining meta to help shape what the company sees as the next wave of computing. and ive is helping openai create its first hardware product. dye’s decision to join meta is “more of a direct threat to apple” compared to the other announced departures, said joe tigay, portfolio manager of the rational equity armor fund. the iphone is still a juggernaut despite facing pressure in ai, iphone sales have been strong and are only expected to climb higher next year. apple is expected to surpass samsung in smartphone shipments this year for the first time since , according to counterpoint research. the company is also one of the few to cross the $ trillion market capitalization threshold, along with ai giants nvidia and microsoft. and change isn’t always a bad

73,"fancy cameras, giant screens and massive storage usually make smartphones more expensive. but next year, it’s a routine component that might be boosting prices: memory. and it’s not just phones. any device that uses memory, from phones to tablets and smartwatches, could get pricier. memory prices are rising for consumer products because major manufacturers are instead ramping up production for ai data centers as artificial intelligence companies boom. “it’s pretty much brutal and crunched across the board,” said yang wang, a senior analyst at counterpoint research. the international data corporation, a global market research firm, reported earlier this week that the smartphone market is expected to decline by .% in in part because of memory shortages. memory prices are expected to surge by % in the fourth quarter of and may climb an additional % early next year, counterpoint research said last month. a boom in data center demand tech companies like meta, microsoft and google have aggressively expanded their data centers and infrastructure this year to keep up with ai demand. and that growth is expected to continue: a report from mckinsey & company indicates companies will invest nearly $ trillion in data center infrastructure-related costs globally by . that’s prompted memory manufacturers like micron and samsung to shift their focus to data centers, which use a different type of memory than computers and smartphones. as a result, there are fewer resources for consumer products, said wang. memory and storage company micron announced on wednesday that it’s exiting the consumer memory business, citing a “surge in demand” coming from “ai-driven growth” in data centers. jaejune kim, executive vice president for memory at samsung, said in october that the company saw strong demand for memory for ai and data centers in the third quarter. he also said the supply shortage for mobile and pc memory is expected to “intensify further.” higher phone prices gadget makers may have to face tough decisions about when to launch and how to price their products, analysts say. trendforce, a research firm that follows the semiconductor industry, estimates memory price hikes have made smartphones % to % more expensive to produce in (higher production costs don’t always translate into higher consumer prices for a variety of reasons). some smartphones could cost more as soon as early next year, said nabila popal, a senior research director for the international data corporation. cheap android phones may see the biggest impact, since less expensive products usually have thinner margins. “it’s going to be almost impossible for them to not raise prices” of cheaper android phones, said popal. companies may also postpone phone launches to focus on expensive models that may be more profitable. the average selling price for smartphones is expected to climb to $ in , compared to $ in , according to popal, putting the smartphone market at a record high value of $. billion. but the pendulum is expected to swing back in the other direction late next year as the supply chain adjusts, according to popal and wang, potentially bringing prices back down or at least capping increases. the semiconductor industry is used to grappling with change as new technologies emerge, says wang. but it may have not been prepared for how quickly ai demand would grow. “in the semiconductor space, there’s always going to be a mismatch (in supply and demand),” he said. “this was kind of unexpected.”",Real

75,"teddy bears and stuffed plushies have long been a mainstay in toy collections. but today they don’t talk back in a child’s imagination — some talk through built-in ai chatbots. sometimes that’s a problem, though: a scarf-wearing teddy bear recently went off the rails during a playtest with researchers and set off alarms for what these toys are capable of. online chatbots can pose risks for adults, from triggering delusions in a small number of cases to hallucinating made-up information. openai’s gpt-o has been the model of choice for some ai toys, and using a large language model (llm) in children’s toys has raised safety questions as to whether children should be exposed to such toys and with what protections toy makers should implement. these risks are ever-present while the ai toy market is booming abroad, with , companies operating in china, according to a massachusetts institute of technology (mit) technology review report. those companies are now selling ai toys in the us, while barbie-maker mattel in june announced a partnership with openai. here’s what you should know about ai-powered toys while the holiday shopping season is in full swing on cyber monday. what is an ai toy? ai toys aren’t the s teddy ruxpin that told stories from cassette tapes. these toys connect to wifi and, using a microphone to understand requests from children, use llms to generate a response — oftentimes verbally through a speaker inside the toy. that allows toys like curio’s grok plushie, miko robots, poe the ai story bear, little learners’ robot mini and keyi technology’s loona robot pet, to provide real-time responses to children. (curio’s grok is not to be confused with elon musk’s chatbot.) what are some of the dangers? as seen in one toy ai bear, those real-time responses could provide inappropriate responses. singapore-based folotoy’s “kumma” bear, priced at $ and powered by openai’s gpt-o, told researchers where to find potentially dangerous objects and engaged in sexually explicit conversations, according to a report released in november by the denver-based consumer advocacy group us public interest research group (pirg) education fund. openai suspended folotoy for violating its policies, which “prohibit any use of our services to exploit, endanger, or sexualize anyone under years old,” according to an openai spokesperson. larry wang, folotoy’s chief executive, told cnn on november that the company had withdrawn the teddy bear and other ai products from its website and is conducting an internal safety audit. but on friday, folotoy announced on x that it has reintroduced the product, “after a rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules.” unlike most ai toys, folotoy’s kumma bear uses a full-fledged llm to freely respond and generate content, making it vulnerable to controversial content, according to subodha kumar, a professor of statistics, operations and data science at temple university’s fox school of business. other toys may use a hybrid model of llms providing responses while programmed to avoid some content. even curio’s grok plushie may suggest “where to find a variety of dangerous household objects” when aggressively prompted, according to pirg. curio has not responded to cnn’s request for comment. chris byrne, a toy industry consultant, told cnn that ai toys that communicate inappropriate messages are a “doomsday” scenario that unfortunately came with the kumma bear, but may not happen with every toy. do these toys have guardrails? few ai toys are ready to be widely used due to addictive design features, inconsistent responses on mature topics and a focus on social companionship instead of being an educational tool, according to pirg. but some toys have protections and filters to avoid inappropriate conversations with a playmate. some ai toys can redirect conversations when asked potentially inappropriate questions. there are also toys, including curio’s grok, which have safety features based on a child’s age range. and toys like the miko may have companion apps that include various degrees of monitoring, whether that’s locking down the toy for a break or real-time transcripts of children’s conversations, like curio’s grok. “it’s a nice idea that parents could actually put in their own guardrails and really control what the toy would talk about and how it would behave,” said r.j. cross, director of pirg’s don’t sell my data campaign. warnings and benefits when mattel released the hello barbie in with a microphone, wifi connection and pre-written responses, concerns arose that the toy was hackable, and that the doll remembered conversations and brought them up days later. similar concerns have surfaced with ai toys, which could potentially store personal data, including children’s names, faces, voices and locations, warned azhelle wade, founder of the toy coach consulting firm. “ai toys feel like a wolf in sheep’s clothing to me, because when using them it’s hard to tell how much privacy you don’t have,” she told cnn in an email. kumar cautioned that data could be vulnerable to data breaches and hacks, but noted that ai toys can be used for language learning and social development. for example, curio’s grok is a companion that can answer questions about leaves and trains, or take on the persona of gollum from “the lord of the rings.” the miko robot has a built-in camera for facial recognition and provides educational and entertainment programs. for $. a month, miko max subscribers can access children’s brands like disney stories, the lingokids app and others.",Real

and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings. authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent. police have reportedly detained a man, who was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry, for suspected sedition on saturday. the petition was also wiped from the internet. two other people, including a former district councillor, were also taken in by police. vcg via getty images hong kong has been blanketed with posters for the legco election political campaigning for the legco election was immediately suspended following the fire, though government-organised debate forums resumed after a few days. carnivals organised for the election campaign were also cancelled. hong kong chief executive john lee insisted the legco election continued as planned as ""we must move forward before we can turn our grief into strength"". he said that the new legislators would be able to quickly support reconstruction and reforms. john p burns, an emeritus professor and chinese politics expert at the university of hong kong, said he believed the government would interpret a high turnout as a sign that voters perceive hong kong's reshaped political system as ""relatively legitimate"". but he expected the numbers to be low, in part due to the tai po fire. he pointed out that most hongkongers have traditionally supported the pan-democrat opposition - which have effectively been barred from taking part. ""i think they won't be convinced to participate this time, just as they mostly stayed away in ."" mobilising pro-establishment voters following the fire would be difficult for the government as well, he added. some in that camp will be impressed by how authorities have speedily re-housed those made homeless in the fire and the aid authorities have provided, ""which by any measure has been rapid and relatively generous"", noted prof burns. but others may have stayed away from the polls as they were ""disappointed, even angry, by the governance problems the fire has exposed"", he said. hong kong's national security office this week reposted a commentary from a pro-beijing news outlet that urged residents to vote to show support for government's reconstruction efforts.

""she feels horrible. she's felt horrible from day one,"" geragos told reporters after she pleaded guilty in the case. ""this has been a horrendous experience."" but how did sangha manage her double life? tony marquez frequently partied with sangha in california weeks before perry's death, sangha spoke over the phone to long-time friend tony marquez. he and others talked to the bbc and presenter amber haque as part of an upcoming documentary on iplayer that looks into the circumstances around perry's death. it marks the first time that friends have opened up about the woman who has become known worldwide as the ketamine queen. sangha and marquez had known each other since the s, and he said he had even met her family. like sangha, marquez was also a regular on the la party circuit. he has also faced legal issues over drugs and has a previous conviction for drug trafficking. but while the two shared a long history, he says sangha never hinted that she was in deep water. only a few months prior, her north hollywood home, which prosecutors dubbed a ""stash house"", had been raided by police. jash negandhi attended university of california in irvine with sangha in and they have remained friends for more than years. ""she was very much into the dance music scene,"" recalls mr negandhi. ""she loved to dance and have a good time."" mr negandhi said he was blindsided by the revelation that his friend was a drug dealer. ""i knew nothing,"" he says. ""absolutely nothing. she hadn't spoken about it."" certainly, most friends assumed she didn't need the money. ""she always had money,"" says marquez. ""she travelled all over by private jet, and did that way before everything blew up."" jash negandhi attended university with sangha sangha's grandparents were fashion retail multimillionaires in east london, according to the times, and sangha – the daughter of entrepreneur nilem singh and dr baljeet singh chhokar – stood to inherit the family wealth. her mother remarried twice and moved to calabasas in california, where sangha grew up. her family home in los angeles is ""beautiful"" and ""big"", according to marquez. ""we would have cookouts or a pool party at her parents' house,"" he says. ""they're very caring, very loving, and they treated us like we were their kids."" sangha spent time in london after high school, and graduated with a mba from the hult international business school in london in . in pictures, she can be seen smiling sweetly at the camera in a smart black suit with straightened brown hair during a visit to the financial times in . ""she didn't come off as a hustler,"" notes one former classmate. sangha was friendly, if somewhat aloof. she wore designer clothes to class, and enjoyed socialising. there were no rumours of involvement in drugs. ""if she was a user in hult, we'd probably know about it."" she returned to los angeles soon after completing her mba. sangha's mother and stepfather ran kfc franchises in california and were sued by the company for more than $, in , court documents show, for failing to pay royalties to the company for the use of its branding. sangha's stepfather declared bankruptcy before the case was over. if sangha's family was experiencing financial difficulty during this period, however, she did not disclose it to many people. ""i didn't hear anything about that,"" says mr negandhi. sangha seemed to want to reach her parents' entrepreneurial accomplishments. she opened a short-lived nail salon stiletto nail bar, and talked to friends about ambitions including owning a franchise of restaurants. drug-fuelled parties that went on for days but her real interest seemed to be in clubbing. in los angeles, she had a close-knit circle of friends called the ""kitties"", according to marquez, which was a clique of mostly female friends who liked to throw parties - attended by celebrities. they would often meet at avalon, a historic theatre in the heart of hollywood that hosts concerts and electronic music events, and party until the early hours of the morning. he says they would take pills and ketamine. sometimes their parties, which they held across california, would go on for days. ""we would take a trip to lake havasu, rent a big old mansion, and we would bring our djs, all our sound systems, and every night would be a theme night that would just be us,"" marquez says of the lake, which borders california and arizona. ""we'd get all dressed up, and we'd have a white party, a glitter party. we had a shroom-shroom party."" these parties ""always involved ketamine"", he says. but even though sangha had many nicknames within this clique of friends, no one ever knew her as ""the ketamine queen"". ""no one called her that,"" says marquez. the group was concerned about contamination of the illegal drug supply with the deadly opioid fentanyl, and therefore went to extraordinary lengths to source large quantities of high-quality ketamine. ""if we were going to do ketamine, we wanted to get it from the source,"" says marquez. the friends allegedly used couriers to go to mexico to retrieve the drug, which is used as a sedative during surgery, from corrupt veterinarians and pharmacies across the border. ""i wouldn't know of jasveen doing that,"" says marquez. ""but did we have access? did we have people that did it? yes."" marquez claims he never suspected sangha was dealing drugs on the side: ""it's shocking, i'm telling you."" ""years and years i've known this person. i know her family. i know the way she acts, i know what she's capable of. i know where she comes from. i cannot – still to this day – i can't believe this is happening,"" he says. looking back, marquez suspects that sangha became ""addicted"" to the social status that came with being a drug dealer to the rich and famous. ""i truly believe that jasveen was addicted to that life of dealing to celebrities,"" he says. ""she was addicted to being in that social circle and being wanted by celebrities that people have seen all their lives on tv."" he said he believes she was never a ""king pin"" or a bigtime dealer, but simply fell into the trade because she ""loved doing ketamine, just like all of us"". sangha's actions suggest a more ruthless streak, however.",Real

""early detection of age-related diseases is key,"" says hidenori fujiwara, a fujitsu spokesperson. ""if doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer."" meanwhile, researchers at waseda university are developing airec, a kg humanoid robot designed to be a ""future"" caregiver. it can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. the scientists at waseda university hope that in the future, airec will be able to change diapers and prevent bedsores in patients. scientists at waseda university in tokyo are developing caregiving robots similar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises. they are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds. although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, assistant professor tamon miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.

""well, he's a top dog in - absolutely, yeah,"" shearer replies coyly, before the pair and gary lineker erupt into fits of giggles. the three ex-footballers are talking about how man city's erling haaland scored his th premier league goal in his th appearance this week - beating shearer's long-standing record over appearances. it's a typical moment of teasing on the rest is football (trif), a podcast that has come to dominate the market with its constant stream of episodes featuring the trio. and it doesn't stop there. goalhanger, the podcast company lineker co-founded and which is behind big brands like the rest is politics, the rest is entertainment and the rest is history, has signed a deal, announced this week, with netflix to turn its football edition into a daily tv show on the streaming service during next summer's world cup, taking place across north america. it's fresh territory not only for this podcast behemoth, but for one man in particular - lineker. is this new venture really needed, and can he succeed? netflix the rest is football features lineker, richards and shearer less than seven months ago lineker was working for the bbc, where he had presented match of the day (motd) for years. richards and shearer frequently joined him as pundits. even after lineker said he would step down from hosting the bbc one saturday night football highlights show following a string of controversies, he was still expected to front the corporation's coverage of the fa cup and world cup in . that all changed after he shared a social media post about zionism which included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult. in response, he said he ""would never consciously repost anything antisemitic"", but ""stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action"". his post on instagram stories was met with outrage by some parts of the jewish community. the charity campaign against antisemitism was among the groups pushing the bbc to sever ties with lineker, saying him staying was ""untenable"". it turns out lineker, , will now be going head-to-head with his old employer. getty images lineker seen here alongside shearer preparing for an motd episode backstage by catching up on games a challenge to the broadcasters - with big bucks the new netflix deal will see the podcast abandon its usual format of lineker, shearer and richards dialling in on video calls of varying quality from their respective homes, and instead turn to a glitzy new york studio. netflix says reporters will beam in from the england camp and fan zones, though there was no word in the streamer's publicity material about scotland, which has also qualified. netflix is not expected to have the rights to show matches live, as the bbc and itv will. for both sports and video podcasting, ""this is a landmark deal,"" according to laura fisher, audio and entertainment analyst at midia research. though podcasts have traditionally been audio-only, video podcasts have been growing in popularity in recent years - and netflix has been bolstering its portfolio to compete with youtube. it announced a deal in october to show several sport, pop culture and true crime video podcasts on its platform. analysts say this could open up the show - and lineker - to a global audience, given netflix's large presence outside the uk. netflix confirmed to bbc news the show will be shown globally, not only in the uk. minal modha, from ampere analysis, says her company's research suggests football is now among the most popular sports in the us, a field in which american football, basketball and baseball loom large. ""for [lineker] to be able to cement himself within that, kind of riding the crest of that wave, i think is going to be really, really helpful for his career,"" she says. while richards is already known in the us given his punditry on the cbs network, this move ""will firmly put lineker on the global stage"", agrees paolo pescatore, technology, media and telecoms analyst at pp foresight. big money is said to be involved. the sun reported that the new deal will ""dwarf"" the £.m lineker was paid by the bbc, which topped the corporation's publicly disclosed salary list when it was released this year. while ms fisher didn't want to speculate, she told us: ""i do think it's safe to guess goalhanger will make more than the £.m."" danehouse/getty images micah richards is already familiar with us audiences on cbs sports when asked by bbc news, goalhanger would not disclose how much the deal was worth. accounts filed in february showed the company had £.m in retained earnings in the year to april , up from about £, the previous year, while cash in the bank rose from £, to more than £.m. the podcasts make money from advertising income, subscription fees and tickets for live shows, former mp rory stewart - who co-hosts the rest is politics with tony blair's former press secretary alastair campbell - told the times in february . it's a lucrative business for its hosts, too. the two presenters each get a third of the profits, stewart said, adding: ""it's good money. i'd say it's championship footballer money. i've earned more this month than i've ever earned doing anything else in my life."" but when audiences can sense that big money is involved, as reported in the trif and netflix deal, it can be offputting to some. ""i think fans are going to be a little bit sceptical, i think they always are, [when] big money comes onto the table,"" ms modha cautions. she adds that lineker ""is not going to want to alienate his fan base"", though she said there's a possibility the format of the podcast could be tweaked to appeal more to a non-football audience, such as through celebrity appearances. the birth of a podcasting empire hulton archive/getty images lineker built a legion of fans during his time as a striker - and brought many of them over with him to match of the day lineker helped launch goalhanger films back in to make sport documentaries, before pivoting to podcasts; his son harry also works for the company as a producer. based in an unassuming shared workspace in south london, goalhanger won uk audio brand of the year at the audio and radio industry awards. its shows currently make up five of the top most-listened-to podcasts in the uk on spotify, and it claims trif gets seven million monthly listeners. during his latter years at motd, lineker was building up his podcasting empire - the first episode of trif was released in summer on platforms including youtube, spotify and apple podcasts. bbc sounds previously co-hosted the podcast but ceased to in may. representatives for lineker declined an interview for this article, but speaking about his departure from the bbc with the standard this week, lineker was positive about not having ""to tread on eggshells anymore"" - a reference to whether or not he could express his personal views on social media while working for a public service broadcaster that prioritises impartiality. ""i get on with my life. i was going to finish on the world cup on bbc so that's the only thing,"" he said. ""and actually, now i'm free to do what i want at the world cup, which i think is great because we'll do a podcast every day."" hollie adams/getty images lineker says that since leaving the bbc, ""now i'm free to do what i want at the world cup"" 'the rest is adverts' - or a smart move? trif is generally liked by listeners, though not all. some reviews on apple podcasts have complain it has too many adverts, with one saying that listening to the hosts reading out adverts sounds like ""nails on a chalkboard"".

102,"in the aftermath of the deadly ambush shooting of two national guard members in washington, d.c., president donald trump and others in his administration immediately blamed trump’s predecessor, joe biden, for failing to vet the afghan national accused of the attack. here, we’ll answer some questions about what we know so far about the suspect and the vetting process. the suspect, -year-old rahmanullah lakanwal, is alleged to have driven across the country from his home in washington state and then shooting west virginia national guard members sarah beckstrom, , an army specialist, and air force staff sgt. andrew wolfe, . beckstrom died later from her injuries, and wolfe remains in critical condition. they were serving as part of what trump has called a crackdown on crime in the nation’s capital. despite trump’s claims that lakanwal and other afghans were “unvetted” and “unchecked,” there are reports that lakanwal was vetted several times, in afghanistan and in the u.s., most recently as part of obtaining asylum status earlier this year. trump officials say lakanwal may have become radicalized while living in the u.s. details about the shooter’s history and possible motivations are still emerging. who is lakanwal? lakanwal is an afghan national who is reported to have been a member of a paramilitary force that worked with the cia during the two-decade war in afghanistan. fox news digital, citing unnamed intelligence sources, reported that lakanwal “had a prior relationship with various entities in the u.s. government, including the cia, due to his work as a member of a partner force in kandahar.” cbs news reported that in afghanistan, lakanwal was part of a so-called “zero unit,” an afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the cia. “the units were exclusively composed of afghan nationals and operated under the umbrella of the national directorate of security, or nds, the intelligence agency established with cia backing for afghanistan’s previous, u.s.-backed government,” cbs news reported. “they were considered by the u.s. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in afghanistan.” fbi director kash patel and cia director john ratcliffe both confirmed that lakanwal worked with a “partner force” in afghanistan that included work with the u.s. government, including the cia. when the country was overtaken by the taliban after u.s. forces withdrew in , lakanwal was among the more than , afghans who were resettled in the united states. jeanine pirro, u.s. attorney for the district of columbia, said lakanwal was living in bellingham, washington, with his wife and five children. fellow guardsmen who responded to the scene shot lakanwal, who is “under heavy guard” at a local hospital, pirro said on nov. . on dec. , he appeared before a judge via video from a hospital bed and pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, assault with intent to kill and illegal possession of a firearm. what is operation allies welcome? lakanwal came to the country under biden’s operation allies welcome following the u.s. military withdrawal from afghanistan. operation allies welcome was initiated via a memo from the biden administration in august “to lead the coordination of ongoing efforts across the federal government to resettle vulnerable afghans, including those who worked on behalf of the united states.” according to a contemporaneous press release about the program from the department of homeland security, those brought to the u.s. would undergo a “rigorous screening and vetting process.” “the u.s. government is working around the clock to conduct the security screening and vetting of vulnerable afghans before they are permitted entry into the united states, consistent with the dual goals of protecting national security and providing protection for our afghan allies,” the press release stated. “as with any population entering the united states, dhs, in coordination with interagency vetting partners, takes multiple steps to ensure that those seeking entry do not pose a national security or public safety risk.” dhs said it deployed personnel from u.s. customs and border protection, immigration and customs enforcement, the transportation security administration, u.s. coast guard, and the secret service to so-called “lily pad” countries — bahrain, germany, kuwait, italy, qatar, spain and the united arab emirates — to process, screen and vet afghan evacuees in conjunction with the departments of defense and state. the “multi-layered” vetting process included “biometric and biographic screenings conducted by intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism professionals from dhs and dod, as well as the federal bureau of investigation (fbi), national counterterrorism center (nctc), and additional intelligence community partners,” the press release said. “this process includes reviewing fingerprints, photos, and other biometric and biographic data for every single afghan before they are cleared to travel to the united states. as with other arrivals at u.s. ports of entry, afghan nationals undergo a primary inspection when they arrive at a u.s. airport, and a secondary inspection is conducted as the circumstances require.” what are trump and other administration officials saying? “i can report tonight that based on the best available information, the department of homeland security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from afghanistan, a hellhole on earth,” trump said in a video message on nov. . “he was flown in by the biden administration in september on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about. nobody knew who was coming in.” trump participates in a call with u.s. service members from his mar-a-lago club in florida on thanksgiving day on nov. . photo by pete marovich/getty images. in a thanksgiving call to military service members, trump held up a photo of afghans crowding onto a plane to flee their home country after its government fell to the taliban in . trump claimed all of the afghan nationals brought to the u.s., including lakanwal, were “unvetted.” “they were unchecked,” trump said. “there were many of them. and they came in on big planes and it was disgraceful. … they just walked in. whoever the strongest people were physically … they got on the planes, there was no check-in. they just swamped the planes, they took off. we had no idea who they were.” in a press conference about the shooting the same day, pirro said, “this is what happens in this country when people are allowed in who are not properly vetted.” “this individual is in this country for one reason and one reason alone, because of the disastrous withdrawal from the biden administration and the failure to vet any way, in any way, shape or form this individual and countless others,” patel said at the same press conference. “the individual, and so many others, should have never been allowed to come here,” ratcliffe told fox news digital. “our citizens and service members deserve far better than to endure the ongoing fallout from the biden administration’s catastrophic failures.” was lakanwal vetted? contrary to the claims of trump and others in his administration, the washington post reported that lakanwal “underwent thorough vetting by counterterrorism authorities before entering the united states, according to people with direct knowledge of the case.” while critics have claimed many evacuees were able to enter the u.s. without proper vetting, “lakanwal, however, would not have been among them, according to the individuals, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation,” the post reported. “one of the individuals said lakanwal was vetted years ago, before working with the cia in afghanistan, and then again before he arrived in the u.s. in . those examinations involved both the national counterterrorism center as well as the cia, the person said.” according to rolling stone, lakanwal “underwent more vetting than most afghans. no one just joined the cia’s zero units. soldiers had to be recommended by a close family member or friend. the cia then vetted each member before even offering a probationary period. the vetting process was so successful that zero units never suffered an insider attack — when afghan soldiers turned against u.s. advisers.” in addition, the rolling stone story said that the roughly , zero unit veterans who resettled in the u.s. “were vetted again” after arriving in the country and “before receiving special immigrant visas, meant for afghan and iraqi nationals who worked for the u.s. government.” samantha vinograd, a former top counterterrorism official at the department of homeland security under biden and now a national security contributor at cbs news, said on cbs’ “face the nation” on nov. that lakanwal’s first vetting would have been over a decade ago by the cia prior to beginning work in the zero unit, “which was a paramilitary and intelligence force that partnered with the cia incredibly closely on some very intense missions.” “but, to be clear, afghan evacuees have been re-vetted since coming to the united states,” vinograd added. “they were re-vetted under the biden administration.” lakanwal also would have been vetted as part of his application for asylum, which was initiated during the biden administration but was approved in april under the trump administration. asked about the trump administration signing off on lakanwal’s asylum application, trump said, “when it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out. no matter how you want to do it, it’s very hard to get them out. but we’re going to be getting them all out now.” “the vetting process … happens when the person comes into the country,” homeland security secretary kristi noem said on nbc news’ “meet the press” on nov. . “and joe biden completely did not vet any of these individuals, did not vet this individual. waited until he got into the united states, and then that application for asylum was opened under the joe biden administration, when he was the president in the white house, and allowed that to go forward with the information that they provided. that’s the biden administration’s responsibility. this is the consequences of the dangerous situation he put our country in when he allowed those people to infiltrate our country during that abandonment of afghanistan.” noem said the trump administration has since tightened the vetting process to include social media checks. asked if there was any vetting as part of the process to approve lakanwal’s asylum request, noem said, “the vetting process all happened under joe biden’s administration.” on the same news program, democratic sen. mark kelly dismissed the trump administration’s blame of the biden administration. “well, this administration, they’re going to blame joe biden on everything,” kelly said. “i mean, it is almost getting comical, you know, at this point. it sounds like there was some vetting done in the last administration. it sounds like they did not do enough vetting before they gave him his asylum claim. she [noem] talked about changing the vetting process. i think that’s a good idea. i mean, when you see an issue and a process that isn’t quite working, especially after we go through an investigation on this individual, if there are things that need to be changed, we should change them.” what concerns have been raised about vetting? a department of homeland security office of inspector general report issued on sept. , , during the biden administration, warned that vetting of afghan evacuees was fraught. “after meeting with more than individuals from the department of homeland security, we determined dhs encountered obstacles to screen, vet, and inspect all afghan evacuees arriving as part of operation allies refuge (oar)/operation allies welcome (oaw),” the report stated. “specifically, u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) did not always have critical data to properly screen, vet, or inspect the evacuees. we determined some information used to vet evacuees through u.s. government databases, such as name, date of birth, identification number, and travel document data, was inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. we also determined cbp admitted or paroled evacuees who were not fully vetted into the united states.” “as a result,” the report said, “dhs may have admitted or paroled individuals into the united states who pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities.” dhs disputed the inspector general’s findings, saying that “the draft report does not adequately acknowledge, and account for, the interagency and multilayered vetting process that started overseas, continued at the u.s. port of entry (poe), and is currently ongoing with recurrent vetting.” a subsequent justice department audit issued in june looked at the fbi’s role in vetting the national security risk posed by afghan evacuees. “according to the fbi, the need to immediately evacuate afghans overtook the normal processes required to determine whether individuals attempting to enter the united states pose a threat to national security, which increased the risk that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation,” the audit said. however, the review found that while afghan evacuees who made it to the u.s. were on the terrorist watchlist, as of july , just nine remain on the list and were “being tracked, as appropriate.” according to the report, “the remaining were removed from the watchlist for a variety of reasons, which included a determination by the fbi that the individual was no longer considered a threat to the united states.” (according to the doj, “watchlist nominations are based on derogatory information, which the tsc [terrorist screening center] defines as intelligence or other information that serves to demonstrate the nature of an individual or group’s association with terrorism.”) vinograd, the former biden administration official, acknowledged on “face the nation” that while there was pressure to expedite vetting “to help our afghan partners and bring at-risk afghans here … protecting national security and public safety was the foremost priority. and that’s why a process was designed that vetted individuals overseas, but it was never intended to be a one-and-done. it was a multistage process with various u.s. government agencies. afghan evacuees were vetted overseas by graphic and biometric vetting. and then there were other stages of vetting that occurred once individuals were here. so we have to put this vetting process in context.” in an appearance on cnn on dec. , andrew mccabe, the former deputy director of the fbi, said that while some republicans are “trying to create the presumption that the mistakes were made under the prior administration,” lakanwal was vetted repeatedly. “vetting is a very imprecise, imperfect science,” mccabe said. “vetting depends exclusively on checking someone out by accessing information that we have in our own possession or can get from the country that that person’s coming from. … essentially we’re left with a process where the absence of any negative information equals a positive result. and that is by definition, you know, not completely reliable.” “there is no guarantee when you look into someone’s background to grant them entry, that they’ll come here and never make a mistake or commit a crime or do something violent,” mccabe said. “this appears to be one of those instances that obviously has gone horribly wrong.” was lack of vetting to blame for the attack? “at this point, we don’t have indications that the horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure,” vinograd said. “instead, the attorney general also said this morning it appears the individual was radicalized once here. “and let’s be clear on what the vetting system is and what it isn’t,” vinograd said. “the vetting system is a system in which an individual’s identifiers, their biographic information and biometric information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images, are run against datasets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history. the vetting system is not predictive of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not at some point going to become violent.” on nbc’s “meet the press” on nov. , noem said, “we believe he [lakanwal] was radicalized since he’s been here in this country. we do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we’re going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members, who talk to them.” a more nuanced picture of lakanwal has begun to emerge since the shooting. rolling stone quoted an afghan veteran who fought alongside him saying lakanwal was struggling with mental illness and an inability to financially provide for his family. the man said lakanwal reached out to the cia for help. the former unit mate, who was not named in the story, said lakanwal lost his job at a laundromat because he didn’t have a work authorization card — even though he was granted asylum. he said lakanwal spoke of isolation and increasing desperation. abc news reported that the recent death of an afghan commander revered by lakanwal had deepened lakanwal’s depression and compounded the stress of his financial burdens. according to the new york times, the units lakanwal served with in afghanistan “had been trained for nighttime raids targeting suspected taliban members, and were accused by human rights groups of widespread killings of civilians.” the times said, “the c.i.a. has denied the allegations of brutality among the units, saying they were the result of taliban propaganda.” cbs news obtained emails sent by a case worker who was working with lakanwal’s family in bellingham, washington, which described a deterioration of lakanwal’s mental health in the last two years. one email described “manic episodes for one or two weeks at a time where he will take off in the family car” and other “interim” episodes in which he “tries to make amends.” according to cbs news, “the case worker, who is not a mental health professional, later said in the email that they believed lakanwal is suffering ‘…ptsd from his work with the us military in afghanistan.'” “rahmanulla was a man who was extremely proud and capable in the world he came from, who felt defeated in the world he came to,” the case worker said. “the investigators haven’t revealed any indication that he was in touch with other radicals,” mccabe said on cnn. “but what is pretty clear is that this person, this lakanwal, went down, really his life sort of devolved in the last year. we know that he was vetted before he was allowed to work with the cia and our special forces folks. if there had been any indication at that time that he had contacts with known terrorists or with sympathetic to taliban or other terrorist viewpoints, he never would have been approved to work with the u.s. military or the cia.” what policy has trump proposed as a result of the shooting? in his video message, trump said, “we must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from afghanistan under biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country.” on x, joe kent, trump’s director of the national counterterrorism center, also blamed poor vetting by the biden administration. “this is why the dc attack happened,” kent wrote. “the solution is rounding up everyone biden let in & deporting them immediately.” in response, u.s. citizenship and immigration services announced, “effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.” the state department, meanwhile, announced on nov. that it had paused visa issuance for individuals traveling on afghan passports. trump subsequently announced that he would “permanently pause migration from all third world countries to allow the u.s. system to fully recover.” on dec. , uscis announced in a memo it was pausing the review of all pending applications for green cards, citizenship or asylum from immigrants from countries that were part of travel restrictions implemented in june. editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. please consider a donation. credit card donations may be made through our “donate” page. if you prefer to give by check, send to: factcheck.org, annenberg public policy center, p.o. box , philadelphia, pa . the post q&a on vetting of accused national guard shooter appeared first on factcheck.org.",Misleading

107,"upending decades-old guidance, the centers for disease control and prevention’s vaccine advisory committee voted to no longer issue a blanket recommendation that all newborns receive a hepatitis b vaccine at birth. throughout the meeting, many panelists made misleading claims about the vaccine. here, we address claims about the vaccine’s effectiveness and safety, and other countries’ vaccination policies. the hepatitis b vaccine, which is typically given in a three-dose series, is highly effective in preventing disease and has a strong safety record. as the children’s hospital of philadelphia explains, there are no known serious side effects other than anaphylaxis, or a life-threatening allergic reaction, which is very rare and can be treated. a universal birth dose was first recommended in , after risk-based approaches had not brought cases down. young children are the most likely to develop a chronic infection that can lead to liver cancer and other problems. in the decades since, rates of hepatitis b in children have fallen by %. in an -to- vote on dec. , the cdc’s advisory committee on immunization practices decided to end that policy. if accepted by the cdc director, parents of babies born to mothers who test negative for the virus will now be advised to discuss vaccination with a doctor to decide “when or if” to give the vaccine. for those who opt to forgo a birth dose, the panel “suggested” waiting at least two months to vaccinate. this type of recommendation, which is known as shared clinical decision-making, has typically been reserved for cases in which experts do not think a vaccine is universally necessary for the recommended group, and there is no “default” answer on whether to vaccinate. the hepatitis b vaccine would remain recommended at birth for babies born to mothers who are infected with the virus and to mothers with unknown status. the changes should not affect health insurance coverage of the shots. numerous experts and medical groups have slammed the decision to end the universal birth dose. “this irresponsible and purposely misleading guidance will lead to more hepatitis b infections in infants and children,” american academy of pediatrics president dr. susan j. kressly said in a statement. “i want to reassure parents and clinicians that there is no new or concerning information about the hepatitis b vaccine that is prompting this change, nor has children’s risk of contracting hepatitis b changed. instead, this is the result of a deliberate strategy to sow fear and distrust among families.” the panel also voted to advise parents to “consult with health care providers” about whether antibody testing should be done to determine if a child needs an additional hbv vaccine. dr. robert malone, center left, speaks during the dec. meeting of the cdc’s advisory committee on immunization practices in atlanta, georgia. photo by elijah nouvelage/getty images. however, experts present at the meeting emphasized that it is not known whether a child who achieves a certain level of antibodies after an incomplete vaccination series will in fact have long-term protection from hepatitis b. dr. adam langer, a cdc staff member with a leadership role in the division tasked with preventing hepatitis, called this “a really huge assumption.” he added, “there really is no reason not to give the full series.” in the past, members of acip were scientists and physicians with particular expertise in vaccinology, pediatrics, and other relevant fields. many of the current panelists, who were hand-selected by health and human services secretary robert f. kennedy jr. beginning in june after he dismissed the existing panel, do not have the typical qualifications and also have expressed views opposed to vaccination. none of the scientific presentations were given by career cdc staff, as is typical. instead, presentations were given by acip member vicky pebsworth, a nurse with a doctorate in public health who has ties to anti-vaccine groups; cynthia nevison, an environmental scientist who has volunteered for safeminds, an anti-vaccine group, and is now a cdc consultant; and mark blaxill, a well-known anti-vaccine advocate with no medical training who was recently hired as a senior adviser at the cdc. presenters also did not use the committee’s usual frameworks to evaluate evidence. dr. joseph r. hibbeln, neuroscientist and acip member, repeatedly complained about the lack of a rigorous scientific framework and the evidence to support the votes. he voted no on both. “no rational science or discussion has been presented on these two novel issues,” he said, noting that no information had been given on why the group should advise vaccination after two months rather than any other timeline, and that there was “no data” on whether the antibody testing would actually work to ensure protection if people were not getting the full series of shots. claims about hepatitis b safety studies in a presentation on the safety of the hepatitis b vaccine birth dose, blaxill claimed that the “safety evidence is limited” and implied the vaccines were not properly tested in placebo-controlled trials. “there were basically no randomized or placebo controlled trials, meaning an inert placebo applied to infants and in comparison to the vaccine,” he said of the clinical trials previous acip members cited when making the birth dose recommendation. this family of claims about placebo-controlled trials, advanced in the past by kennedy, relies on narrowly defining placebos and on the faulty assumption that a randomized trial with a saline placebo is the only way to show the safety of a vaccine. vaccines often are compared with other types of controls, such as other vaccines. looking at the data available today, there have been more than half a dozen randomized, controlled trials on the safety of the hepatitis b vaccine birth dose, a dec. report from the vaccine integrity project, an initiative of the university of minnesota’s center for infectious disease research and policy, found. these include studies that compared the safety of giving vaccines at birth versus on a delayed schedule. in addition, the review detailed other types of safety studies done in the decades the vaccine has been given to infants at birth and also pointed out that the u.s. and other countries have ongoing vaccine safety programs. “results of randomized trials, large national safety monitoring programs, and long-term follow-up studies consistently demonstrate that the hepatitis b vaccine is safe regardless of vaccine timing,” the review said. “no safety benefits were identified for a delayed first dose versus vaccination at birth.” flawed claim about multiple sclerosis dr. evelyn griffin, an acip member who is an ob-gyn from louisiana, misleadingly suggested during discussions that the hepatitis b vaccine might cause multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly attacks the protective covering around nerve fibers. “there are signals of autoimmune conditions,” she said of the hepatitis b vaccine. “multiple sclerosis, for example, is a large signal.” later, she claimed that “a large number of studies” show an association between the vaccine and “multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions,” while acknowledging that associations are not necessarily causal. she wondered whether hepatitis b vaccination should “be paused in the meantime, so that we don’t continue autoimmune risks.” it’s true that in the s, case reports in france sparked concerns about the hepatitis b vaccine and ms. but as an archived cdc webpage explains, the issue has now been studied more rigorously. “a large body of scientific evidence now shows that hepatitis b vaccination does not cause or worsen ms,” the webpage, which was last reviewed in , says. a french study failed to find any link between hepatitis b vaccination and childhood onset ms, while numerous others have looked at adults and also not found associations. the world health organization’s global advisory committee on vaccine safety has concluded that there is “no association” between the hepatitis b vaccine and ms. the group has also reviewed a couple of outlier studies that have claimed to identify possible links, but has found the evidence unconvincing. several systematic reviews have also concluded there is no link. misleading claim about antibody waning in her presentation, nevison misleadingly suggested that starting hepatitis b vaccination at birth could be putting people at risk later in life because of waning immunity. while antibody levels do drop over time, there is no evidence that people are getting sick as a result of declining immunity. antibodies “wane the most rapidly in children who begin their primary series as infants, especially as newborns,” nevison’s slides read. “while most vaccinees respond well to a booster dose, some of those vaccinated as infants may lack protection when they enter their years of highest risk for acquiring hepatitis b.” noting that he disagreed with many statements in the earlier presentations, including nevison’s, dr. h. cody meissner, a pediatric infectious diseases expert and acip member, explained that it is well known that antibodies wane and in some cases disappear after hepatitis b vaccination. but the focus on antibodies is faulty, he said, because other parts of the immune system are very strong and can still provide protection even if antibodies have declined. he said he did not know of a single healthy vaccinated person later developing hepatitis b disease as a result of waning immunity. “i think the evidence is very strong that there is lifelong immunity to hepatitis b after completing the series,” he said. meissner voted against both proposals. langer, the cdc expert, confirmed later in the meeting that the only instances of breakthrough infections had been in people who had, for example, immunocompromising conditions, and that the agency was not aware of any instances of a properly vaccinated, healthy person ever developing hepatitis b. dr. amy middleman, a pediatric and adolescent medicine physician at university hospitals babies & children’s in cleveland and a liaison to acip for the society for adolescent health and medicine, objected to nevison’s interpretation of one of middleman’s studies from . “the entire point of our study is that for most vaccines, the anamnestic response is really their superpower,” she said, referring to the immune system’s ability to respond more quickly and more strongly when encountering a particular antigen again. “so this study shows that memory cells exist such that when they see something that looks like the hepatitis b [virus], they actually attack. the presence of a robust and anamnestic response, regardless of circulating antibody years later, shows true protection, and there was no difference in response based on when the dose was given.” “in fact, % of those with any detectable antibody and % of those with zero antibody displayed persistent immunity to a challenge,” middleman added, referring to a follow-up study she co-authored. comparisons between countries meeting attendees repeatedly compared the u.s. hepatitis b vaccine recommendations with those in other countries, calling the u.s. an “outlier” among peer nations. “the united states’ universal recommendation of the hepatitis b vaccine birth dose is an outlier among developed countries with low hepatitis b prevalence,” an hhs press release announcing the altered recommendations also said. however, as we’ve written previously, countries that do not have universal policies differ from the u.s. in multiple ways. in countries with these so-called selective strategies, children whose mothers test negative for hepatitis b typically are recommended to receive the vaccine later, often at months of age, although sometimes as late as adolescence. “the united states is a unique country,” langer said during the meeting. “i think that most of us would agree that we don’t really have a peer nation in this world.” the world health organization recommends a birth dose of the hepatitis b vaccine, and out of member states have adopted this policy. nations with more selective vaccination strategies are concentrated in europe. “while appropriate to consider us vaccine guidance in the context of global recommendations, us vaccination policies were developed and revised to address real-world challenges related to hepatitis b epidemiology, populations at risk, continuity of care, access to care, costs, and other considerations —that are unique to the us and its healthcare system,” the vaccine integrity project report says. acip member pebsworth presented a slide showing that a variety of countries with relatively low chronic hepatitis b prevalence do not give a universal birth dose. “this graph shows that the u.s. is an outlier,” she said. she is chair of the committee’s new work group on the childhood and adolescent vaccine schedule, which was tasked with assessing the hepatitis b birth dose in advance of the meeting. however, the u.s. achieved its relatively low rate of hepatitis b after decades of using public health measures to prevent childhood infections, including recommending a universal birth dose. on her slide, pebsworth cited data on international vaccine policy that langer had presented at the prior september acip meeting. but at that meeting, langer also showed data indicating that countries with selective birth dose policies generally have higher rates of successful screening for hepatitis b during pregnancy and also have universal health care — context pebsworth did not mention. during the december meeting, langer expanded on this point, using denmark as an example. denmark’s vaccine policies have often been cited to question u.s. recommendations. but langer said that not only does denmark have a lower population than new york city and a high rate of hepatitis b screening in pregnant women, it also provides free prenatal care “for both citizens and refugee or asylum seekers,” unlike the u.s. in addition, he said that denmark collects health information on its population on an individual level, tying it to an identification number, and follows babies of mothers who screen positive for hepatitis b to make sure the babies are protected. “in the united states, many of these infants are lost to follow-up as soon as they leave the hospital,” he said. langer said that perhaps a better peer nation is canada. while hepatitis b vaccination recommendations for children there vary by region, he said, studies recently “have shown that universal hepatitis b birth dose is going to be needed to achieve elimination of hep b in canada.” indeed, a may study by canadian researchers argued for a universal birth dose, explaining that a current risk-based policy in ontario has not entirely prevented hepatitis b cases in children. in addition, the researchers wrote that areas that long ago adopted the universal birth dose now have lower hepatitis b rates in adults than those areas with selective policies. canadian analyses have also found the birth dose to be cost-effective compared with delaying the vaccine until adolescence. editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. please consider a donation.

108,"the head of the food and drug administration’s vaccine division claimed in a leaked email that “at least children” died from covid- vaccination, using that to justify major vaccine regulatory changes. experts, however, say too little information was provided to verify the claim. studies and safety assessments in the u.s. and other countries have repeatedly shown that the covid- vaccines are remarkably safe, including for children, and do not increase mortality risk. while serious side effects can occur, they are rare. dr. vinay prasad, the official who penned the memo, used the alleged deaths to announce a variety of ways in which the agency would be more stringent in approving future vaccines, which some experts say are unnecessary and impractical and could reduce access to shots. in a perspective published dec. in the new england journal of medicine, a dozen former fda commissioners assailed the memo, saying prasad’s proposals would “impede the ability to update vaccines” and “suppress innovation and competition,” ultimately “disadvantag[ing]” the american people. they added that deaths reported to the cdc and fda previously “had been carefully reviewed by fda staff, who drew different conclusions.” prasad was installed as the director of the center for biologics evaluation and research, which oversees vaccines, in may after his predecessor said health and human services secretary robert f. kennedy jr. forced him to resign. the email was sent to all cber staff on nov. and obtained by multiple news outlets the same day. “i am writing to report that obpv career staff have found that at least children have died after and because of receiving covid- vaccination. these deaths are related to vaccination (likely/probable/possible attribution made by staff),” prasad opened the lengthy email, referring to cber’s office of biostatistics and pharmacovigilance. “this safety signal has far reaching implications for americans, the us pandemic response, and the agency itself.” prasad went on to explain that dr. tracy beth høeg, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician and then-fda adviser, started investigating reports of death in children from the vaccine adverse event reporting system, or vaers, over the summer. by late summer, she had determined “there were in fact deaths,” he said. (on dec. , the fda announced that høeg had been appointed acting director of the fda’s drug evaluation center.) vaers is an early warning system that accepts unvetted reports of health problems from anyone following vaccination. the reports do not necessarily mean a vaccine caused a problem, as many events are coincidental. government websites for vaers repeatedly caution that it is usually not possible to determine from vaers data alone whether a vaccine caused an event. prasad said he then asked obpv to analyze deaths reported to vaers and that the resulting “initial analysis of deaths between and ″ found “no fewer than are related” to vaccination. he added that the coding was conservative and the “real number is higher.” fda cber director dr. vinay prasad in may . “this is a profound revelation,” he continued. “for the first time, the us fda will acknowledge that covid- vaccines have killed american children.” in closing the email, prasad said he remained “open to vigorous discussions and debate” but that staff who did not agree with his “core principles and operating principles” should resign. prasad did not include details on any of the cases, including age, cause of death or which vaccine had been administered. while he referred to myocarditis in the email, he did not specifically say that the deaths were related to the condition. myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is a known side effect of the covid- vaccines. it is, however, rare, and while it can be serious, is typically mild and less severe than the myocarditis that is caused by other viral infections, including the coronavirus. experts told us and other news outlets that given the lack of information, it was unclear how reliable the assessments were. some also objected to other claims in the email. “the memo [is] factually incorrect, misleading and disingenuous,” dr. anna durbin, a vaccine researcher at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health, told us. prasad “has not provided any evidence to support his conclusion that the vaccine caused the deaths yet asserts he knows the vaccine caused them,” she said, adding that the deaths should be independently investigated. the fda did not reply to our inquiry asking for more information, but told the biotech news outlet endpoints news on dec. that the agency intended to “make a report publicly available by the end of this month.” alleged deaths given the lack of detail, experts said it was difficult to evaluate prasad’s claim of “at least ” vaccine-related deaths in children. “it is impossible to tell from the comments of prasad any details of the cases and whether they have been comprehensively reviewed and other causes of death have been excluded,” dr. kathryn edwards, a now-retired vanderbilt university vaccinologist and pediatrician who served on both the cdc and fda’s vaccine advisory panels, told us in an email. “all deaths reported to vaers are investigated more fully, but some of the reports do not have comprehensive tests for other causes or autopsies to assess multiple organs.” she added that it is “conceivable” that there were some vaccine-related deaths in kids, “but we have not seen the science to confirm this.” in previous administrations, durbin said, reports of vaers investigations would include how the review of deaths was done, who did the review, and how they came to their conclusions. “we do not have any of this for these. until we do, it is difficult to assess how rigorous the review was,” she said. “were those staffers qualified to do the review? i don’t know because none of that information was provided.” by prasad’s description, however, it appears that the count includes cases that were deemed only possibly related to vaccination. one “can never prove with % certainty that the vaccine did not contribute to the death, so one might question what they meant by ‘possible,’” susan s. ellenberg, a biostatistician at the university of pennsylvania’s perelman school of medicine who oversaw vaers at the fda between and , told us in an email. she said it would be interesting to know which types of deaths were considered possible and which were not, as well as how many of the were likely or probable versus possible. durbin said it would be “very unusual” to consider cases vaccine-related if there is another possible or probable cause. typically, vaccine safety investigations begin but do not end in vaers. as we’ve explained previously, and a cdc website notes, the system is good at detecting potential safety issues, but such signals are then investigated through other vaccine safety surveillance systems, such as the vaccine safety datalink, which draws information from u.s. health care organizations. such investigations have revealed that myocarditis is a side effect of vaccination, but there is no evidence that the vaccines increase the risk of death. during a safety update presentation before the vaccine advisory panel in june, a cdc staffer reviewed the existing data, noting that the agency is “confident” that “there’s no increased risk of mortality” after covid- vaccination. vaccine-related myocarditis is most common — albeit still rare — in teen and young adult males after a second dose. it is very rare in children below the age of and virtually nonexistent in children below the age of , according to the presentation. in recent years, too, the risk of developing myocarditis after covid- vaccination has fallen. a cdc follow-up study of around - to -year-olds experiencing myocarditis after vaccination found that % were fully or probably fully recovered after three months, with the rate rising to more than % after at least one year. there were no known deaths or cardiac transplants. it is nevertheless possible that vaccination could be fatal in extremely rare circumstances. there have been isolated reports in the scientific literature of lethal instances of myocarditis that occurred after vaccination, including two cases in teen boys in the u.s. the risk, however, is very low. one korean study identified deaths from vaccine-related myocarditis among million people who were vaccinated with at least one dose. while covid- is usually mild in children, it has caused deaths and many cases of severe disease. “the number of confirmed covid deaths in children is certainly higher than ,” jeffrey morris, director of the division of biostatistics at the university of pennsylvania, told us in an email, adding that the risks go beyond death to hospitalizations, icu stays, and serious inflammatory syndromes and long covid. for a while, although death remained rare, covid- was the eighth leading cause of death in people years of age and younger, and the leading cause of infectious disease deaths. cdc data show that around , children have died from covid-, including confirmed cases between july and july , which the agency said is likely an undercount. regulatory changes using the alleged vaers deaths as a rationale, prasad then proposed broad changes to how the fda approves vaccines, stating the agency would no longer allow antibody data to be used as a proxy for efficacy when evaluating a new vaccine or extending an existing vaccine to a new population. the method is sometimes called immunobridging. he also said the fda would “revise” the framework for approving seasonal influenza vaccines — which he said was “an evidence-based catastrophe” — and would reassess how the agency evaluates the safety of vaccines given at the same time. in their nejm piece, the former fda commissioners explained that immunobridging studies have long been accepted by the agency and are important for updating vaccines against pathogens that rapidly evolve. “the proposed measures will slow the replacement of older products with better ones and will create potentially prohibitive expenses for new market entrants,” they wrote, adding that the changes would also reduce competition and increase prices. “moreover, insisting on long, expensive outcomes studies for every updated formulation would delay the arrival of better-matched vaccines when new outbreaks emerge or when additional groups of patients could benefit.” we previously explained the validity of immunobridging when addressing claims from makary and høeg in about the covid- vaccine approvals in children, which were approved based on the method. “as a former chair of the vaccine advisory committee, vrbpac, i can say that vaccines are carefully and meticulously assessed for effectiveness and safety and the reviewers at the fda are experts,” edwards said, when asked about prasad’s policy changes. “these comments do not consider any of the adverse events caused by the diseases that the vaccines prevent. none of the benefits of vaccines are acknowledged and none of the rich history and experience of vaccinologists is being called on.” other claims experts took issue with several of prasad’s other claims, including the suggestion that the biden administration mandated covid- vaccines in schools — the federal government does not have that power — and the idea that there is not “reliable” data on the benefits of covid- vaccination in children. the fda commissioners called the latter assertion incorrect. “reasonable scientists should engage in open debate about how best to shape recommendations for children at lower risk for covid-,” they wrote, “but substantial evidence shows that vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization in many children and adolescents.” prasad also implied that the u.s. should have first identified myocarditis as a rare side effect of vaccination instead of israel. but as durbin pointed out, israel began vaccinating earlier and also had the benefit of a universal health care system, which makes it much easier to detect safety signals. prasad said that he has seen “no evidence that covid- vaccines, which do not halt transmission, benefit third parties.” morris told us that his comments misrepresent the evidence. before the arrival of the omicron variant in , the vaccines were quite effective in preventing infection and thereby reducing transmission. that has since changed significantly, but even now, there is evidence that vaccination helps prevent spread of the virus to at least some degree for a period of time. the main benefit of the vaccines, however, is to prevent severe disease and death. editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on

109,"in the aftermath of the deadly ambush shooting of two national guard members in washington, d.c., president donald trump and others in his administration immediately blamed trump’s predecessor, joe biden, for failing to vet the afghan national accused of the attack. here, we’ll answer some questions about what we know so far about the suspect and the vetting process. the suspect, -year-old rahmanullah lakanwal, is alleged to have driven across the country from his home in washington state and then shooting west virginia national guard members sarah beckstrom, , an army specialist, and air force staff sgt. andrew wolfe, . beckstrom died later from her injuries, and wolfe remains in critical condition. they were serving as part of what trump has called a crackdown on crime in the nation’s capital. despite trump’s claims that lakanwal and other afghans were “unvetted” and “unchecked,” there are reports that lakanwal was vetted several times, in afghanistan and in the u.s., most recently as part of obtaining asylum status earlier this year. trump officials say lakanwal may have become radicalized while living in the u.s. details about the shooter’s history and possible motivations are still emerging. who is lakanwal? lakanwal is an afghan national who is reported to have been a member of a paramilitary force that worked with the cia during the two-decade war in afghanistan. fox news digital, citing unnamed intelligence sources, reported that lakanwal “had a prior relationship with various entities in the u.s. government, including the cia, due to his work as a member of a partner force in kandahar.” cbs news reported that in afghanistan, lakanwal was part of a so-called “zero unit,” an afghan intelligence unit and paramilitary force that worked with the cia. “the units were exclusively composed of afghan nationals and operated under the umbrella of the national directorate of security, or nds, the intelligence agency established with cia backing for afghanistan’s previous, u.s.-backed government,” cbs news reported. “they were considered by the u.s. and its international partners to be among the most trusted domestic forces in afghanistan.” fbi director kash patel and cia director john ratcliffe both confirmed that lakanwal worked with a “partner force” in afghanistan that included work with the u.s. government, including the cia. when the country was overtaken by the taliban after u.s. forces withdrew in , lakanwal was among the more than , afghans who were resettled in the united states. jeanine pirro, u.s. attorney for the district of columbia, said lakanwal was living in bellingham, washington, with his wife and five children. fellow guardsmen who responded to the scene shot lakanwal, who is “under heavy guard” at a local hospital, pirro said on nov. . on dec. , he appeared before a judge via video from a hospital bed and pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, assault with intent to kill and illegal possession of a firearm. what is operation allies welcome? lakanwal came to the country under biden’s operation allies welcome following the u.s. military withdrawal from afghanistan. operation allies welcome was initiated via a memo from the biden administration in august “to lead the coordination of ongoing efforts across the federal government to resettle vulnerable afghans, including those who worked on behalf of the united states.” according to a contemporaneous press release about the program from the department of homeland security, those brought to the u.s. would undergo a “rigorous screening and vetting process.” “the u.s. government is working around the clock to conduct the security screening and vetting of vulnerable afghans before they are permitted entry into the united states, consistent with the dual goals of protecting national security and providing protection for our afghan allies,” the press release stated. “as with any population entering the united states, dhs, in coordination with interagency vetting partners, takes multiple steps to ensure that those seeking entry do not pose a national security or public safety risk.” dhs said it deployed personnel from u.s. customs and border protection, immigration and customs enforcement, the transportation security administration, u.s. coast guard, and the secret service to so-called “lily pad” countries — bahrain, germany, kuwait, italy, qatar, spain and the united arab emirates — to process, screen and vet afghan evacuees in conjunction with the departments of defense and state. the “multi-layered” vetting process included “biometric and biographic screenings conducted by intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism professionals from dhs and dod, as well as the federal bureau of investigation (fbi), national counterterrorism center (nctc), and additional intelligence community partners,” the press release said. “this process includes reviewing fingerprints, photos, and other biometric and biographic data for every single afghan before they are cleared to travel to the united states. as with other arrivals at u.s. ports of entry, afghan nationals undergo a primary inspection when they arrive at a u.s. airport, and a secondary inspection is conducted as the circumstances require.” what are trump and other administration officials saying? “i can report tonight that based on the best available information, the department of homeland security is confident that the suspect in custody is a foreigner who entered our country from afghanistan, a hellhole on earth,” trump said in a video message on nov. . “he was flown in by the biden administration in september on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about. nobody knew who was coming in.” trump participates in a call with u.s. service members from his mar-a-lago club in florida on thanksgiving day on nov. . photo by pete marovich/getty images. in a thanksgiving call to military service members, trump held up a photo of afghans crowding onto a plane to flee their home country after its government fell to the taliban in . trump claimed all of the afghan nationals brought to the u.s., including lakanwal, were “unvetted.” “they were unchecked,” trump said. “there were many of them. and they came in on big planes and it was disgraceful. … they just walked in. whoever the strongest people were physically … they got on the planes, there was no check-in. they just swamped the planes, they took off. we had no idea who they were.” in a press conference about the shooting the same day, pirro said, “this is what happens in this country when people are allowed in who are not properly vetted.” “this individual is in this country for one reason and one reason alone, because of the disastrous withdrawal from the biden administration and the failure to vet any way, in any way, shape or form this individual and countless others,” patel said at the same press conference. “the individual, and so many others, should have never been allowed to come here,” ratcliffe told fox news digital. “our citizens and service members deserve far better than to endure the ongoing fallout from the biden administration’s catastrophic failures.” was lakanwal vetted? contrary to the claims of trump and others in his administration, the washington post reported that lakanwal “underwent thorough vetting by counterterrorism authorities before entering the united states, according to people with direct knowledge of the case.” while critics have claimed many evacuees were able to enter the u.s. without proper vetting, “lakanwal, however, would not have been among them, according to the individuals, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation,” the post reported. “one of the individuals said lakanwal was vetted years ago, before working with the cia in afghanistan, and then again before he arrived in the u.s. in . those examinations involved both the national counterterrorism center as well as the cia, the person said.” according to rolling stone, lakanwal “underwent more vetting than most afghans. no one just joined the cia’s zero units. soldiers had to be recommended by a close family member or friend. the cia then vetted each member before even offering a probationary period. the vetting process was so successful that zero units never suffered an insider attack — when afghan soldiers turned against u.s. advisers.” in addition, the rolling stone story said that the roughly , zero unit veterans who resettled in the u.s. “were vetted again” after arriving in the country and “before receiving special immigrant visas, meant for afghan and iraqi nationals who worked for the u.s. government.” samantha vinograd, a former top counterterrorism official at the department of homeland security under biden and now a national security contributor at cbs news, said on cbs’ “face the nation” on nov. that lakanwal’s first vetting would have been over a decade ago by the cia prior to beginning work in the zero unit, “which was a paramilitary and intelligence force that partnered with the cia incredibly closely on some very intense missions.” “but, to be clear, afghan evacuees have been re-vetted since coming to the united states,” vinograd added. “they were re-vetted under the biden administration.” lakanwal also would have been vetted as part of his application for asylum, which was initiated during the biden administration but was approved in april under the trump administration. asked about the trump administration signing off on lakanwal’s asylum application, trump said, “when it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out. no matter how you want to do it, it’s very hard to get them out. but we’re going to be getting them all out now.” “the vetting process … happens when the person comes into the country,” homeland security secretary kristi noem said on nbc news’ “meet the press” on nov. . “and joe biden completely did not vet any of these individuals, did not vet this individual. waited until he got into the united states, and then that application for asylum was opened under the joe biden administration, when he was the president in the white house, and allowed that to go forward with the information that they provided. that’s the biden administration’s responsibility. this is the consequences of the dangerous situation he put our country in when he allowed those people to infiltrate our country during that abandonment of afghanistan.” noem said the trump administration has since tightened the vetting process to include social media checks. asked if there was any vetting as part of the process to approve lakanwal’s asylum request, noem said, “the vetting process all happened under joe biden’s administration.” on the same news program, democratic sen. mark kelly dismissed the trump administration’s blame of the biden administration. “well, this administration, they’re going to blame joe biden on everything,” kelly said. “i mean, it is almost getting comical, you know, at this point. it sounds like there was some vetting done in the last administration. it sounds like they did not do enough vetting before they gave him his asylum claim. she [noem] talked about changing the vetting process. i think that’s a good idea. i mean, when you see an issue and a process that isn’t quite working, especially after we go through an investigation on this individual, if there are things that need to be changed, we should change them.” what concerns have been raised about vetting? a department of homeland security office of inspector general report issued on sept. , , during the biden administration, warned that vetting of afghan evacuees was fraught. “after meeting with more than individuals from the department of homeland security, we determined dhs encountered obstacles to screen, vet, and inspect all afghan evacuees arriving as part of operation allies refuge (oar)/operation allies welcome (oaw),” the report stated. “specifically, u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) did not always have critical data to properly screen, vet, or inspect the evacuees. we determined some information used to vet evacuees through u.s. government databases, such as name, date of birth, identification number, and travel document data, was inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. we also determined cbp admitted or paroled evacuees who were not fully vetted into the united states.” “as a result,” the report said, “dhs may have admitted or paroled individuals into the united states who pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities.” dhs disputed the inspector general’s findings, saying that “the draft report does not adequately acknowledge, and account for, the interagency and multilayered vetting process that started overseas, continued at the u.s. port of entry (poe), and is currently ongoing with recurrent vetting.” a subsequent justice department audit issued in june looked at the fbi’s role in vetting the national security risk posed by afghan evacuees. “according to the fbi, the need to immediately evacuate afghans overtook the normal processes required to determine whether individuals attempting to enter the united states pose a threat to national security, which increased the risk that bad actors could try to exploit the expedited evacuation,” the audit said. however, the review found that while afghan evacuees who made it to the u.s. were on the terrorist watchlist, as of july , just nine remain on the list and were “being tracked, as appropriate.” according to the report, “the remaining were removed from the watchlist for a variety of reasons, which included a determination by the fbi that the individual was no longer considered a threat to the united states.” (according to the doj, “watchlist nominations are based on derogatory information, which the tsc [terrorist screening center] defines as intelligence or other information that serves to demonstrate the nature of an individual or group’s association with terrorism.”) vinograd, the former biden administration official, acknowledged on “face the nation” that while there was pressure to expedite vetting “to help our afghan partners and bring at-risk afghans here … protecting national security and public safety was the foremost priority. and that’s why a process was designed that vetted individuals overseas, but it was never intended to be a one-and-done. it was a multistage process with various u.s. government agencies. afghan evacuees were vetted overseas by graphic and biometric vetting. and then there were other stages of vetting that occurred once individuals were here. so we have to put this vetting process in context.” in an appearance on cnn on dec. , andrew mccabe, the former deputy director of the fbi, said that while some republicans are “trying to create the presumption that the mistakes were made under the prior administration,” lakanwal was vetted repeatedly. “vetting is a very imprecise, imperfect science,” mccabe said. “vetting depends exclusively on checking someone out by accessing information that we have in our own possession or can get from the country that that person’s coming from. … essentially we’re left with a process where the absence of any negative information equals a positive result. and that is by definition, you know, not completely reliable.” “there is no guarantee when you look into someone’s background to grant them entry, that they’ll come here and never make a mistake or commit a crime or do something violent,” mccabe said. “this appears to be one of those instances that obviously has gone horribly wrong.” was lack of vetting to blame for the attack? “at this point, we don’t have indications that the horrific tragedy was a result of a vetting failure,” vinograd said. “instead, the attorney general also said this morning it appears the individual was radicalized once here. “and let’s be clear on what the vetting system is and what it isn’t,” vinograd said. “the vetting system is a system in which an individual’s identifiers, their biographic information and biometric information, iris scans, fingerprints, facial images, are run against datasets of information about individuals with ties to terrorism and criminal history. the vetting system is not predictive of whether an individual with no derogatory information is or is not at some point going to become violent.” on nbc’s “meet the press” on nov. , noem said, “we believe he [lakanwal] was radicalized since he’s been here in this country. we do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we’re going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members, who talk to them.” a more nuanced picture of lakanwal has begun to emerge since the shooting. rolling stone quoted an afghan veteran who fought alongside him saying lakanwal was struggling with mental illness and an inability to financially provide for his family. the man said lakanwal reached out to the cia for help. the former unit mate, who was not named in the story, said lakanwal lost his job at a laundromat because he didn’t have a work authorization card — even though he was granted asylum. he said lakanwal spoke of isolation and increasing desperation. abc news reported that the recent death of an afghan commander revered by lakanwal had deepened lakanwal’s depression and compounded the stress of his financial burdens. according to the new york times, the units lakanwal served with in afghanistan “had been trained for nighttime raids targeting suspected taliban members, and were accused by human rights groups of widespread killings of civilians.” the times said, “the c.i.a. has denied the allegations of brutality among the units, saying they were the result of taliban propaganda.” cbs news obtained emails sent by a case worker who was working with lakanwal’s family in bellingham, washington, which described a deterioration of lakanwal’s mental health in the last two years. one email described “manic episodes for one or two weeks at a time where he will take off in the family car” and other “interim” episodes in which he “tries to make amends.” according to cbs news, “the case worker, who is not a mental health professional, later said in the email that they believed lakanwal is suffering ‘…ptsd from his work with the us military in afghanistan.'” “rahmanulla was a man who was extremely proud and capable in the world he came from, who felt defeated in the world he came to,” the case worker said. “the investigators haven’t revealed any indication that he was in touch with other radicals,” mccabe said on cnn. “but what is pretty clear is that this person, this lakanwal, went down, really his life sort of devolved in the last year. we know that he was vetted before he was allowed to work with the cia and our special forces folks. if there had been any indication at that time that he had contacts with known terrorists or with sympathetic to taliban or other terrorist viewpoints, he never would have been approved to work with the u.s. military or the cia.” what policy has trump proposed as a result of the shooting? in his video message, trump said, “we must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from afghanistan under biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country.” on x, joe kent, trump’s director of the national counterterrorism center, also blamed poor vetting by the biden administration. “this is why the dc attack happened,” kent wrote. “the solution is rounding up everyone biden let in & deporting them immediately.” in response, u.s. citizenship and immigration services announced, “effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.” the state department, meanwhile, announced on nov. that it had paused visa issuance for individuals traveling on afghan passports. trump subsequently announced that he would “permanently pause migration from all third world countries to allow the u.s. system to fully recover.” on dec. , uscis announced in a memo it was pausing the review of all pending applications for green cards, citizenship or asylum from immigrants from countries that were part of travel restrictions implemented in june. editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. please consider a donation. credit card donations may be made through our “donate” page. if you prefer to give by check, send to: factcheck.org, annenberg public policy center, p.o. box , philadelphia, pa .",Misleading
110,"the vaccine advisory committee of the centers for disease control and prevention is scheduled to meet dec. and . on the agenda: the hepatitis b vaccine, the overall childhood vaccine schedule and vaccine ingredients. we’ll summarize what we’ve written about these topics and what the committee has said about them in recent meetings. the group, called the advisory committee on immunization practices, was reconstituted in june by health and human services secretary robert f. kennedy jr. the committee has since departed from its normal evidence-based procedures and has made changes to its vaccine recommendations amid misleading claims about vaccine safety. as we have written, the panel previously was scheduled to vote in september on a recommendation to delay the birth dose of the hepatitis b vaccine but tabled the vote at the last minute. the committee presented no clear rationale for why it was considering delaying the birth dose, and one member cited “trust,” and not safety, as the motivator. since universal hepatitis b vaccination for infants was recommended in , hepatitis b infections in children have fallen by %. babies and young children who are infected with the hepatitis b virus are disproportionately likely to develop chronic infections, which can lead to liver failure and liver cancer. also on the bare-bones agenda are items related to the vaccine schedule, vaccine safety monitoring and a presentation titled “adjuvants and contaminants.” the committee also typically votes during its fall meeting to approve the next year’s vaccine schedule documents, jason schwartz, who studies vaccination policy at the yale school of public health, told us in an email. these documents compile existing recommendations as a resource for health care providers and parents. such votes are on the design and footnotes of the documents but do not affect “the underlying recommendations” and do not have “immediate consequences for vaccine access or affordability,” he explained. acip members dr. kirk milhoan and dr. james pagano attend the group’s sept. meeting. milhoan is now acip chair. photo by elijah nouvelage/getty images. the committee will meet this week under new leadership. on dec. , hhs announced that biostatistician and epidemiologist martin kulldorff’s short tenure as chair of the committee was over and that he had been appointed to a leadership role in the office of the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation. the committee’s new chair is pediatric cardiologist dr. kirk milhoan, another kennedy appointee, who has a history of promoting treatments for covid- that are not evidence-based and making unfounded claims about covid- vaccination. milhoan confirmed to the washington post that the group would vote on delaying the hepatitis b birth dose, although the extent of the delay is “still being finalized,” he said. he also said that the group would discuss the effects of the childhood vaccine schedule on chronic health conditions. in october, the cdc staffers tasked with supporting the committee were let go, according to the guardian. meanwhile at the food and drug administration, a leaked nov. letter from vaccines regulatory division head dr. vinay prasad announced a new, stricter framework for regulating vaccines. he justified this proposal by claiming, with little detail to back it up, that covid- vaccines had killed at least children. fda senior adviser dr. tracy beth høeg, a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician, was involved in the investigation into the safety of the covid- vaccines, prasad wrote. høeg is an ex officio member of acip. hepatitis b birth dose hepatitis b vaccination takes up the majority of the agenda on the meeting’s first day, which includes an anticipated vote on whether to delay the birth dose. kennedy long has misleadingly claimed that it’s unnecessary to give a dose of the hepatitis b vaccine at birth because the virus is spread via sexual contact and drug use. but an infected mother can transmit the virus to her baby during birth or after, and it also can be spread by other family members or close contacts through minute amounts of blood. getting a hepatitis b vaccine at birth provides a safety net for babies, in case an infection in a mother is missed or the baby is later exposed to another infected person. about half of people in the u.s. who have hepatitis b do not know it, according to data presented at the september meeting by a cdc staff scientist. a dec. review by the vaccine integrity project, conducted in advance of the anticipated hepatitis b vaccine vote, found “no evidence of any health benefit with delaying the birth dose and identified only risks related to changing current us recommendations for universal hepatitis b vaccination.” the vaccine integrity project is an initiative of the university of minnesota’s center for infectious disease research and policy that provides evidence-based information on vaccination. opponents of the universal birth dose of the hepatitis b vaccine have questioned why some countries have different hepatitis b vaccine strategies than the u.s., but the cdc presentation pointed out that many of these countries have a higher rate than the u.s. of successfully screening mothers for hepatitis b before they give birth and also have universal health care systems. the move toward changing hepatitis b vaccine recommendations was introduced during an acip meeting in june, preceding the september meeting in which the group discussed but failed to vote on whether the birth dose should be delayed by one month. the group did vote to recommend that all women be tested for hepatitis b during pregnancy. however, this is “already standard clinical practice and outside acip’s purview,” a review of the meeting by former acip members pointed out. the member who made the motion to table the hepatitis b vaccine vote, dr. robert malone, subsequently said he had done so because the proposed delay was “not sufficient.” malone has for years spread false and misleading information about vaccines. later in september, president donald trump suggested that the first dose of the hepatitis b vaccine should be delayed until years of age. the september presentations leading up to the tabled hepatitis b vote offered little detail on topics that would ordinarily be discussed before changing vaccine recommendations, including whether there could be practical ramifications from changing the vaccine schedule. however, the nonprofit vaccinate your family and others have expressed concerns that changing the timing of a child’s first dose of the hepatitis b vaccine could affect subsequent doses, making it more difficult to use certain commonly used combination vaccines. the childhood vaccine schedule recommends three hepatitis b vaccine doses. “changes to recommendations for any component within a combination vaccine risk reducing options for families and could disrupt vaccine supply and limit access for years,” the pharmaceutical company sanofi wrote in a nov. public comment posted in advance of the acip meeting. “these supply challenges would extend beyond combination vaccines to include stand-alone vaccines that prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, haemophilus influenzae type b, and polio.” sanofi makes vaxelis, a combination vaccine protecting against hepatitis b along with these other listed diseases. vaccine ingredients and the vaccine schedule the second day of the meeting will focus on a wide variety of topics related to vaccine safety, “adjuvants and contaminants,” and the vaccine schedule overall, per the agenda. no votes are listed on the agenda for this day. it is unclear precisely what the presentations will cover, but the topics overlap with interests of a new acip work group established under kennedy. this group will review “the safety and effectiveness” of the childhood and adolescent vaccine schedule, per a document posted in october. in this document, the work group suggested it would revisit when and in what order vaccines are given and which vaccines should be given together, for example. as we have written previously, new vaccines are studied in the context of the current vaccine schedule and are approved if shown to be safe and effective. a dec. post on the substack unbiased science explained that the vaccine schedule has been built over time based on multiple considerations, related to ideal timing to get the best protection, established safety of giving immunizations at the same time, and practicality. acip chair milhoan also told the washington post that the committee is beginning a discussion of aluminum adjuvants, an interest also noted in the new work group document. adjuvants are substances added to vaccines in small amounts to improve a person’s immune response to the vaccines’ main ingredients. the most commonly used vaccine adjuvants are aluminum salts, which were discovered to work for this purpose nearly years ago. in recent months, kennedy has made incorrect and misleading statements about aluminum adjuvants, cherry-picking and misusing data from a july danish study to claim that aluminum in vaccines has been linked to autism. in fact, this large study found no association between aluminum in vaccines and chronic conditions, including autism. kennedy also ordered a nov. update to a cdc webpage on vaccines and autism, which repeated these claims about the danish study. the webpage also cited evidence of “a positive association between vaccine-related aluminum exposure and persistent asthma,” based on a cdc-funded study. however, the new cdc webpage failed to note that the danish researchers, who originally set out to replicate the study, did not find an association between aluminum content in vaccines and asthma. the first author of the study, pediatrician dr. matthew daley of kaiser permanente colorado’s institute for health research, in july told stat that the new danish study was “well done” and “reassuring.” the acip agenda does not specify what “contaminants” will be discussed. at the group’s september meeting, presenters discussed alleged “dna contamination” in mrna covid- vaccines. however, claims of higher-than-expected levels of dna in covid- vaccines are based on flawed analyses that have been contradicted by other assessments. moreover, as we have written before, the small quantity of dna left over in vaccines from the manufacturing process is expected and is not considered contamination.

111,"after six congressional democrats released a video advising members of the u.s. military and national security community to “refuse illegal orders,” president donald trump said the lawmakers should be tried in court for “seditious behavior, punishable by death!” but legal experts told us this was not sedition and that the legislators were restating the law that only lawful orders must be followed. “sedition is trying to overthrow the government with force or violence,” eric r. carpenter, a professor of law at florida international university college of law, said in an email to us. “in the video, the elected officials are just telling service members to follow the law. they are not telling service members to overthrow the government.” the white house later said that trump didn’t mean the democrats should face the death penalty, but the press secretary argued that the video encouraged troops to defy the president. here, we cover what the lawmakers said, how trump responded, and what legal experts have said about the video and the president’s claims. what’s in the video? the -second video was posted on social media and online on nov. and features sen. elissa slotkin of michigan, sen. mark kelly of arizona, rep. maggie goodlander of new hampshire, rep. jason crow of colorado, and reps. chris deluzio and chrissy houlahan of pennsylvania. all are either military veterans or former intelligence officials. in the video, the lawmakers state their credentials and remind members of the military and national security community that they swore to protect and defend the u.s. constitution. “right now, the threats to our constitution aren’t just coming from abroad, but from right here at home,” deluzio, a former navy officer, and crow, a former army ranger and paratrooper, say, in turn. kelly, a former navy captain, then says, “our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders,” which slotkin, once a cia officer, repeats for emphasis. crow then adds that military members “must refuse illegal orders,” before the other lawmakers say “no one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.” the ad concludes with the members of congress saying, “don’t give up the ship,” a reference to a last command attributed to james lawrence, a navy captain, during the war of . the senators and representatives never mention a specific unlawful order they believe was given. but the new york times reported on nov. that slotkin, who organized the video, “said that she had heard from active-duty troops who were concerned about the legality of strikes that have targeted people accused by the trump administration of trafficking narcotics by sea.” “some wondered whether they could be held personally liable for the deaths, she said,” according to the times. (we have written that some legal experts have said the u.s. strikes on boats off the coasts of venezuela and colombia were “not lawful.”) in an abc news interview on nov. , slotkin said she was “not aware of things that are illegal” that trump has ordered the military to do. but she said “certainly there are some legal gymnastics that are going on with these caribbean strikes.” she also said she has concerns about “the use of u.s. military on american shores,” and she noted that “we’ve seen now the courts overturn” trump’s “deployment of u.s. military into our streets,” including in washington, d.c., and los angeles. the video “was basically a warning to say, like, if you’re asked to do something, particularly against american citizens, you have the ability to go to your jag officer and push back,” she said, referring to military lawyers known as judge advocates general. trump’s response two days after the video was posted, trump responded on social media, calling the democratic lawmakers traitors guilty of sedition. “it’s called seditious behavior at the highest level,” the president wrote on truth social. “each one of these traitors to our country should be arrested and put on trial. their words cannot be allowed to stand – we won’t have a country anymore!!! an example must be set.” in another post, he labeled it, “seditious behavior, punishable by death!” he also amplified a post from another user, who wrote, “hang them george washington would !!” his comments elicited a response from the six democrats, who issued a joint statement the same day. “what’s most telling is that the president considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. it is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty,” they said. white house press secretary karoline leavitt clarified in a nov. press briefing that trump doesn’t think the lawmakers should be executed. she said he only responded that way because members of congress “conspired together to orchestrate a video message” encouraging members of the military and national security apparatus “to defy the president’s lawful orders.” “the sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command and if that chain of command is broken, it can lead to people getting killed. it can lead to chaos. and that’s what these members of congress who swore an oath to abide by the constitution are essentially encouraging,” she said. but the democrats said to “refuse illegal orders” — not “lawful” ones. it’s a crime to disobey “any lawful general order or regulation,” according to the uniform code of military justice. carpenter told us there is a “strong presumption” that military orders are lawful and must be followed by members of the military. “they refuse orders at their own risk,” he cautioned. he said that service members have a legal defense for any actions taken while they are following legal orders, but that defense doesn’t apply if they are following unlawful orders. “so, the basic rule is, follow orders unless they are obviously unlawful.” did the lawmakers commit sedition? as for trump’s sedition claim, generally, federal law says that “seditious conspiracy” occurs when multiple people conspire to “overthrow,” “put down,” “destroy by force,” “levy war against” or “oppose by force” the u.s. government. the penalty for seditious conspiracy is a maximum of years in prison, a fine or both – but not death. (active-duty and certain retired members of the armed forces who commit “sedition,” as defined by the ucmj, may be punished by death, the military code says.) but legal experts in addition to carpenter told us that the message in the democrats’ video does not amount to sedition. “trump’s efforts to cast this legal speech as seditious is nonsense,” victor m. hansen, a professor of law at new england law in boston, said in an email. “these statements are not seditious or any evidence of a conspiracy,” the former army jag officer said. “simply reminding service members of their legal rights and obligations is not criminal in any way.” “it is so far from seditious behavior,” berit berger, a former federal prosecutor, said in a nov. cnn interview, noting that sedition “is a specific crime” that “requires advocating” or “planning to overthrow the government through force.” for example, several people who plotted and participated in the jan. , , attack on the u.s. capitol to prevent the transfer of presidential power were convicted of seditious conspiracy. berger said sedition is rarely prosecuted and “it’s very hard to charge somebody with sedition based just on something they say” since “people have a right to criticize their government, to say things, even inflammatory things, that the government might not like.” brenner m. fissell, a professor of law at villanova university and vice president of the national institute of military justice, told us that current law prevents the seditious conspiracy statute from being applied as “broadly” as it was written. he pointed to the supreme court’s ruling in the first amendment case brandenburg v. ohio. “under the brandenburg test, speech would have to be intended to produce imminent lawlessness, and also likely to produce imminent lawlessness,” he said. “the lawmakers’ video would fail the imminence requirement, but it also does not advocate lawlessness — it is merely re-stating the military law” that “only lawful orders require obedience.” “so, the video is not sedition or seditious conspiracy,” fissell said. carpenter said that if an elected official “is retired and an officer, then they could be prosecuted for conduct unbecoming an officer.” but even that would be a “stretch” in this case, he argued, because “they were just telling service members to follow the basic legal structure.” defense secretary pete hegseth announced on nov. that kelly, the arizona senator who retired as a high-ranking navy official, is now under investigation for his participation in the video. editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. please consider a donation. credit card donations may be made through our “donate” page. if you prefer to give by check, send to: factcheck.org, annenberg public policy center, p.o. box , philadelphia, pa .",Misleading
112,"defense secretary pete hegseth claimed that he received “total exoneration” in an investigative report by the defense department’s office of inspector general regarding a signal group chat about a military attack in yemen. but the report contradicts that assessment, concluding that hegseth’s messages “created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed u.s. mission objectives and potential harm to u.s. pilots.” the inspector general report, which was issued dec. and publicly released two days later, also faulted hegseth for using a personal cell phone to relay sensitive dod information, and for not retaining the signal conversations as official records, as required by federal law and pentagon policy. the chat between top administration national security officials on signal, a private encrypted messaging app, came to light because jeffrey goldberg, editor-in-chief of the atlantic, was inadvertently added to the group chat by national security adviser michael waltz, who was later removed from his job. in one of the messages, hegseth appeared to provide a timeline for impending u.s. military strikes in yemen on march . according to the atlantic, two hours before the scheduled start of the bombing in yemen, hegseth shared this in the group chat: “time now (et): weather is favorable. just confirmed w centcom we are a go for mission launch.“ “et: f-s launch (st strike package)” “: ‘trigger based’ f- st strike window starts (target terrorist is @ his known location so should be on time – also, strike drones launch (mq-s)” “: more f-s launch (nd strike package)” “: strike drones on target (this is when the first bombs will definitely drop, pending earlier ‘trigger based’ targets)” “ f- nd strike starts – also, first sea-based tomahawks launched.” although hegseth declined to sit for an interview with the inspector general, he provided a written statement on july in which he insisted he provided only an “unclassified summary” of the operation in the signal chat. “i am the original classification authority and, in this capacity, i retain the sole discretion to decide whether something should be classified or whether classified materials no longer require protection and can be declassified,” hegseth wrote to the inspector general. a copy of his statement was attached to the report. “i took non-specific general details which i determined, in my sole discretion, were either not classified, or that i could safely declassify. in making this determination, i chose to keep the details only to the overt actions of dod assets, which would be readily apparent to any observer in the area and did not include any details about targets or intelligence which may have been derived from other agencies outside of dod. the purpose of this was to give the principals in the chat thread a heads up on the timeline, as i knew they were going to shortly be notifying partner nations and within hours would also be giving media interviews about what we had done.” secretary of defense pete hegseth waits in the cabinet room before president donald trump’s bilateral lunch with polish president karol nawrocki on sept. . official white house photo by molly riley. the inspector general report noted that while the information was classified when it was provided to hegseth, it agreed that as head of the department of defense, hegseth has the “authority to determine the required level of classification for any dod information he communicates, such as through a document, message, or speech.” in response to that conclusion, hegseth’s spokesman, sean parnell, released a statement, saying: “this inspector general review is a total exoneration of secretary hegseth and proves what we knew all along – no classified information was shared. this matter is resolved and the case is closed.” hegseth reposted parnell’s statement on x and echoed his sentiments: “no classified information. total exoneration. case closed. houthis bombed into submission. thank you for your attention to this ig report.” in a separate statement, npr reported, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said, “this review affirms what the administration has said from the beginning — no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.” the report did conclude that hegseth had the authority to declassify any information sent via signal, but the inspector general’s report was not a “total exoneration,” as hegseth put it. in his written response to investigators, hegseth said that “there were no details that would endanger our troops or the mission.” however, the ig concluded, “[i]f this information had fallen into the hands of u.s. adversaries, houthi forces might have been able to counter u.s. forces or reposition personnel and assets to avoid planned u.s. strikes. even though these events did not ultimately occur, the secretary’s actions created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed u.s. mission objectives and potential harm to u.s. pilots.” “the secretary’s transmission of nonpublic operational information over signal to an uncleared journalist and others to hours before planned strikes using his personal cell phone exposed sensitive dod information,” the report said. “using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic dod information through signal risks potential compromise of sensitive dod information, which could cause harm to dod personnel and mission objectives.” while hegseth had the authority to declassify the information, the report noted that based on hegseth’s written statement, he did send “sensitive, nonpublic, operational information over signal from his personal cell phone.” the inspector general said that action violated department of defense policy, “which prohibits using a personal device for official business and using a nonapproved commercially available messaging application to send nonpublic dod information.” the inspector general also concluded that hegseth violated federal recordkeeping laws and defense department policy about retaining public records. “specifically, those regulations require officers and employees of executive branch agencies and dod employees to forward a complete copy of any record created on a nonofficial electronic messaging account to an official account within days of the original creation or transmission of the record,” the report said. editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on grants and individual donations from

113,"president donald trump pardoned juan orlando hernández, the former president of honduras, on dec. , claiming without evidence that his prosecution had been a “setup” by the biden administration and that hernández was targeted because he was president of a country where drug cartels operated. “if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn’t mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life,” trump said in explaining the pardon. then-honduran president juan orlando hernández presents a statement at cop on nov. , , in glasgow, scotland. photo by andy buchanan – pool/getty images. but hernández had been found guilty by a jury after a three-week trial. he was sentenced by a u.s. district judge last year to years in prison for using his position to help drug traffickers import more than tons of cocaine into the united states, while accepting bribes to fuel his political career and protecting violent drug cartel leaders from prosecution in return. white house press secretary karoline leavitt defended trump’s action as a reversal of “over-prosecution” by the biden administration. hernández had been targeted because he was “opposed to the values of the previous administration,” leavitt told reporters on dec. . we asked the white house for evidence or further explanation that hernández’s case had been a “setup” or “over-prosecution” by the biden administration, but we didn’t receive any response beyond the statements made by the president and leavitt on dec. . hernández was released from a federal prison in west virginia on dec. . here, we will examine the case against hernández, trump’s explanation for the pardon, and the response to trump’s action. the indictment according to the indictment filed on jan. , , in the u.s. district court in the southern district of new york, from about to , hernández “participated in a corrupt and violent drug-trafficking conspiracy to facilitate the importation of tons of cocaine into the united states.” he received “millions of dollars from multiple drug-trafficking organizations in honduras, mexico, and elsewhere, including from the former leader of the sinaloa cartel, joaquin guzman loera,” the mexican drug kingpin known as “el chapo.” hernández used the drug money to fund his political campaigns and commit voter fraud, the indictment said. “in exchange, hernández protected drug traffickers, including his brother and former member of the honduran national congress juan antonio hernández alvarado … from investigation, arrest, and extradition; caused sensitive law enforcement and military information to be provided to drug traffickers to assist their criminal activities; caused members of the honduran national police and military to protect drug shipments in honduras; and allowed brutal violence to be committed without consequence.” hernández “contributed with his co-conspirators to honduras becoming one of the largest transshipment points in the world for united states-bound cocaine,” the indictment also said. loads of cocaine were trafficked through honduras from colombia and venezuela by boat and air. (the trump administration has been building up the u.s. military presence in the caribbean in recent months and striking alleged drug-running boats off the coasts of venezuela and colombia, as we’ve previously written.) hernández, who had served two terms as president of honduras from to , was extradited to the u.s. in april and was convicted in march after a three-week jury trial on cocaine trafficking and weapons offenses. the investigation into honduras as a drug-trafficking route and the eventual prosecution of hernández dates back to , the new york times reported. emil bove iii, who was then a department of justice prosecutor, helped lead that investigation. bove later became a key defense lawyer for trump and is now an appeals court judge. during the trial, according to news coverage, hernández testified that he had championed anti-crime legislation and worked with the u.s. to fight drug cartels. he said the witnesses against him — which included former drug traffickers — were “professional liars.” hernández also said he was the victim of “a political persecution.” in addition to former drug traffickers, the witnesses included a honduran investigator and evidence from notebooks of drug transactions with hernández’s initials. in closing arguments, assistant u.s. attorney jacob gutwillig said hernández had protected some drug traffickers “with the full power of the state” and that he “paved a cocaine superhighway to the united states.” on june , , hernández was sentenced to years in prison by district court judge p. kevin castel, who was nominated by president george w. bush. castel called hernández “a two-faced politician hungry for power” who pretended to be fighting against drug traffickers while working with them. u.s. attorney damian williams said in a justice department press release at the time: “hernández helped to facilitate the importation of an almost unfathomable tons of cocaine to this country: billions of individual doses sent to the united states with the protection and support of the former president of honduras.” attorney general merrick b. garland said hernández “abused his power to support one of the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world, and the people of honduras and the united states bore the consequences.” the pardon in late october, a month before trump announced he would pardon the former honduran president, hernández sent a letter, obtained by the times, to trump seeking a review of his case. in the letter to trump, hernández, who led the conservative national party, said he “suffered political persecution, targeted by the biden-harris administration not for any wrongdoing, but for political reasons.” he also told trump that “like you, i was recklessly attacked by radical leftist forces who could not tolerate change, who conspired with drug traffickers and resorted to false accusations, lawfare, and selective justice to destroy what we had achieved and clear the path for the honduran radical left’s return to power.” trump ally and adviser roger stone, who had supported the release of hernández, said he gave the letter to trump, reuters reported. a white house official told the times that trump had not read the letter before announcing he would pardon hernández. in a truth social post on nov. , in which trump expressed support in the recent honduran presidential election for conservative candidate nasry “tito” asfura, a political ally of hernández, trump wrote, “i will be granting a full and complete pardon to former president juan orlando hernandez who has been, according to many people that i greatly respect, treated very harshly and unfairly.” (the honduran election results, delayed by technical problems, showed asfura and liberal party candidate salvador nasralla in an extremely close race as of dec. .) explaining the pardon to reporters on nov. , trump said, “well, i was told, i was asked by honduras, many of the people of honduras, they said it was a biden setup. … the people of honduras really thought [hernández] was set up and it was a terrible thing.” “he was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country,” trump continued. “and they said it was a biden administration setup. and i looked at the facts and i agreed with them.” the next day at a white house briefing, leavitt was asked how trump’s defense of hernández differs from the administration’s targeting of venezuelan president nicolás maduro, whom the administration has called the leader of a drug cartel. leavitt responded: “you’re cherry-picking the president’s statement a little bit yesterday, as he also said yesterday the people of honduras have highlighted to him how the former president hernández was set up. this was a clear biden over-prosecution. he was the president of this country. he was in the opposition party. he was opposed to the values of the previous administration and they charged him because he was president of honduras.” leavitt noted that hernández “shared that his conviction was lawfare by the leftist party who, quote, struck a deal with the biden-harris administration.” “hernández has highlighted there was virtually no independent evidence presented,” leavitt said, and “his conviction was based on testimony from many admitted criminals who hoped that cooperating would reduce their own penalties.” trump “heard the concerns from many people, as he does, and he’s of course within his constitutional authority to sign clemency for whomever he deems worthy of that,” leavitt said. hernández could still face charges in his home country. after trump’s plan to pardon hernández was announced, honduras attorney general johel zelaya reportedly said prosecutors there would be “obligated to take action … so that justice may prevail and impunity may be brought to an end.” zelaya did not specify what charges hernández may face, but the associated press reported there were various corruption investigations during his two terms in office. reaction to the pardon there was bipartisan criticism from u.s. lawmakers in the aftermath of the pardon announcement. democratic rep. norma j. torres of california sent a letter to trump on nov. urging him not to grant the pardon, writing: “the victims of hernández’s crimes, including tens of thousands of american families who lost loved ones to cocaine overdoses, deserve justice. … a pardon would tell these victims that their lives don’t matter and that power can buy freedom even after conviction.” republican sen. bill cassidy of louisiana asked on x, “why would we pardon this guy and then go after maduro for running drugs into the united states? lock up every drug runner! don’t understand why he is being pardoned.” democratic rep. seth moulton of massachusetts said in a dec. interview on cnn that the pardon is “completely absurd. it’s totally hypocritical and it just shows that they are completely unserious about actually dealing with narcotraffickers. they’re not addressing the drug problem. and this honduran president has been proven in a court of law to be responsible for poisoning thousands of americans and trump gives him a pardon?” republican rep. maria elvira salazar of florida told cnn that while she supports trump’s efforts to oust venezuela’s maduro, she did not agree with his decision to pardon hernández. “i would have never done that,” she said. “i would have not taken that action.” speaking to reporters on dec. about the pardon, republican sen. thom tillis of north carolina said, “i hate it. it’s a horrible message. … it’s confusing to say on the one hand we should potentially even consider invading venezuela for drug traffick[ing], and on the other hand let somebody go.” editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. please consider a

114,"the house voted nearly unanimously on nov. to force the department of justice to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to the investigation and prosecution of jeffrey epstein. after resisting the release for months, president donald trump threw his late support to the bill, which he signed shortly after the senate also passed it by unanimous consent. epstein, a financier, was arrested on charges of sex trafficking of minors in july and died in prison a month later. his death was ruled a suicide by the department of justice. federal prosecutors alleged epstein had “sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls” from to . a week before the vote, democrats on the house oversight committee released several emails that they said called into question trump’s relationship with epstein and whether he had knowledge of epstein’s crimes. the same day, republicans on the committee released , pages of documents from epstein’s estate. in the days before and after the bill passed, lawmakers from both parties hurled accusations against political opponents related to epstein and the contents of some of the released documents. here, we’ll sort out what’s behind some of those claims. stansbury’s unsupported claims involving trump democratic rep. melanie stansbury claimed during a nov. appearance on cnn that the recently released epstein documents “name multiple cases involving sexual assault conversations epstein had that involved the president and his time at his house, and the evidence that donald trump absolutely knew that ghislaine maxwell was recruiting and grooming young women from mar-a-lago and bringing them to epstein’s house.” both parts of that claim overstate what the documents have revealed so far. stansbury’s comments leave the false impression that evidence has been released showing that trump “absolutely knew” about recruitment and sexual abuse of underage girls. her office referred us to emails that only show epstein making comments that could be interpreted that way but don’t show evidence of trump knowing about criminal acts. maxwell was convicted and sentenced to years in jail in for helping epstein to recruit and groom victims under years of age. when we asked stansbury’s office for the evidence to support the claim, a spokeswoman provided four email exchanges from the recent release. some of them show that epstein had said that trump knew about his recruitment of girls from mar-a-lago through maxwell. the messages don’t specify if epstein was talking about underage girls. some of them show that epstein had said that trump had been at his house with girls, although they don’t explicitly say anything about sexual assault. billionaire jeffrey epstein in cambridge, massachusetts, on sept. , . photo by rick friedman/corbis via getty images. first, we’ll assess the claim that “donald trump absolutely knew that ghislaine maxwell was recruiting and grooming young women from mar-a-lago.” on nov. , democrats released three emails from a total of about , documents belonging to epstein. one of those emails, from epstein to the author michael wolff, referred to mar-a-lago and trump and said, “of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.” when a reporter asked trump two days later, on nov. , “what did jeffrey epstein mean in his emails when he said you knew about the girls?” trump responded, “i know nothing about that.” over the summer, trump said he knew that epstein had been hiring female employees from mar-a-lago, but the president’s comments didn’t pertain to any knowledge of epstein abusing girls. the president was receiving questions at the time about a birthday message to epstein that featured a drawing of a naked woman and appeared to have trump’s signature — although trump has denied that he wrote the message. “i have a great spa, one of the best spas in the world at mar-a-lago and people were taken out of the spa, hired by him. in other words, gone. and other people would come and complain this guy is taking people from the spa. i didn’t know that. and then when i heard about it, i told him, i said, listen, we don’t want you taking our people,” trump said on july , referring to epstein. “whether it was spa or not spa, i don’t want them taking people and he was fine and then not too long after that, he did it again and i said, ‘out of here.’” in a follow-up question, a reporter asked if one of the workers recruited from mar-a-lago was virginia giuffre, who was one of the women who came forward to publicly accuse epstein of abusing her while she was underage. she died by suicide in april. giuffre has explained that maxwell first approached her when she was working at mar-a-lago at the age of . “i think that was one of the people. yeah. he stole her,” trump said. second, we’ll assess the claim that the documents show “multiple cases involving sexual assault conversations epstein had that involved the president and his time at his house.” the emails highlighted by stansbury show that, in , epstein had corresponded with landon thomas, who wrote the new york magazine story famously quoting trump saying of epstein, “he’s a lot of fun to be with. it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do, and many of them are on the younger side. no doubt about it — jeffrey enjoys his social life.” in one email to thomas, epstein wrote, “would you like photso [sic] of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen,” although it’s unclear whether or not he had such photos. another email exchange highlighted by stansbury was between epstein and maxwell in . there, epstein wrote, “i want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [victim’s name was redacted] spent hours at my house with him.” in an email that epstein had sent to himself in , he recounted parts of the plea agreement under which he admitted to soliciting minors for prostitution, which was a state charge in florida. he wrote in that email that trump “came to my house many times during that period.” there have been various accounts over the years about when trump stopped socializing with epstein — most of them put the time frame in the early s, before epstein’s first arrest in . recently trump has characterized the time he spent with epstein as minimal, saying on nov. , while he hosted saudi crown prince mohammad bin salman, “i have nothing to do with jeffrey epstein. i threw him out of my club many years ago because i thought he was a sick pervert.” when asked about the emails at a nov. briefing, white house press secretary karoline leavitt said, “these emails prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that president trump did nothing wrong.” epstein’s communications with house delegate plaskett in the released files, virgin islands delegate to the house of representatives stacey plaskett, a democrat, was confirmed to have had text exchanges with epstein. on nov. , house republicans introduced a resolution to censure plaskett for “colluding with convicted felony sex offender jeffrey epstein during a congressional hearing.” the censure attempt failed, but a few days later, republican rep. james comer claimed during a fox news interview that plaskett was colluding with epstein to take trump “down.” “a few months after that communication between plaskett and epstein, jamie raskin named stacey plaskett as an impeachment manager,” comer said. “so she was an impeachment manager in congress, and she was communicating and colluding with jeffrey epstein to try to take donald trump down.” colluding is a subjective word, but we’ll break down the communication between plaskett and epstein. (as a delegate, plaskett can participate in house debates, but she does not get a vote in house floor sessions.) the text messages, which were first reported by the washington post, show plaskett and epstein exchanging several texts before and during a congressional hearing in february involving trump’s former personal lawyer michael cohen — years after epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and to solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of in . (a few months after the hearing, in early july , epstein was arrested on charges of sex trafficking of minors.) cohen was testifying about trump’s alleged misconduct in falsifying business records in order to pay “hush money” to silence a porn star shortly before the election. trump was found guilty in a new york court in of falsifying business records as part of an illegal scheme to influence the election; he recently appealed the conviction. the washington post reported that plaskett exchanged several texts before and during the hearing, with epstein appearing to have influenced plaskett’s line of questioning with cohen. at : p.m., epstein texted plaskett, “hes opened the door to questions re who are the other hechmen at trump org.” plaskett responded, “yup. very aware and waiting my turn.” later in the hearing, plaskett asked cohen about other associates in the trump organization whom the house “should be meeting with.” in another exchange, the washington post reported that epstein texted plaskett that “cohen brought up rona – keeper of the secrets.” plaskett responded: “rona?? quick i’m up next is that an acronym?” epstein was referring to rhona graff, a former personal assistant to trump and senior vice president of the trump organization. following this exchange, plaskett asked about graff later in her questioning of cohen. epstein and plaskett also exchanged personal messages, according to the post. earlier in the hearing, epstein texted plaskett: “great outfit” and “you look great” to which plaskett responded, “thanks!” plaskett has since denied any wrongdoing. after the washington post article was published on nov. , plaskett’s office released a statement distancing the congresswoman from epstein. “during the hearing, congresswoman plaskett received texts from staff, constituents and the public at large offering advice, support and in some cases partisan vitriol, including from epstein,” her office wrote. “as a former prosecutor she welcomes information that helps her get at the truth and took on the gop that was trying to bury the truth. the congresswoman has previously made clear her long record combating sexual assault and human trafficking, her disgust over epstein’s deviant behavior and her support for his victims.” five days later during a nov. cnn interview, in response to a question asking about her relationship with epstein, plaskett responded, “jeffrey epstein was a constituent.” (epstein owned a pair of islands in the virgin islands.) in response to another question asking why she was in contact with epstein despite his known status as a sex offender, plaskett responded, “i’ve been a prosecutor for many years. and there are a lot of people who have information that are not your friends that you use to get information for to get at the truth.” she later went on to say, “as a prosecutor, you get information from people where you can. i’ve interviewed confidential informants. i’ve interviewed narcotics, drug traffickers and others, and that doesn’t mean that i’m their friend. … it means that they have information that i need. and that i’m trying to get at the truth, and that’s what i did.” plaskett has previously been involved in other controversies surrounding political donations from epstein. an abc news report found that in the and election cycles, plaskett received $, from epstein, which she later pledged to donate to organizations working with women and children. crockett misses mark with accusations about epstein donations defending plaskett from the house floor on nov. , rep. jasmine crockett said republicans could spare her “with your moral high grounds.” “folks who also took money from somebody named jeffrey epstein, as i had my team dig in very quickly: mitt romney, the nrcc, lee zeldin, george bush, win red, mccain-palin, rick lazio,” crockett said. “i just want to be clear, if this is the standard we are going to make, just know, we’re going to expose it all. and just know, that the fec filings, they are there for everybody to review.” but as zeldin, now the epa administrator, later pointed out on x, the jeffrey epstein who contributed to his house reelection campaign is not the jeffrey epstein. as the federal election commission records note, the jeffrey epstein who contributed a total of $, to zeldin in is a long island, new york, physician. another jeffrey epstein from new jersey who contributed $ to zeldin in february is the owner of a beverage company, fec records indicate. moreover, all of the contributions were made in , and epstein, the convicted sex offender, died in august . “yes crockett, a physician named dr. jeffrey epstein (who is a totally different person than the other jeffrey epstein) donated to a prior campaign of mine,” zeldin posted on x. “no freakin relation you genius!!!” three $ contributions to romney’s presidential campaign in were also made by a jeffrey epstein who is listed as a physician living in long island, the same physician who donated $ in to the mccain-palin campaign. in an interview on nov. , cnn anchor kaitlin collins asked crockett if she wanted to set the record straight. “listen, i never said that it was that jeffrey epstein,” crockett said. “just so that people understand, when you make a donation, your picture is not there. and because they decided to spring this on us, in real-time, i wanted the republicans to think about what could potentially happen, because i knew that they didn’t even try to go through the fec. so my team, what they did is they googled, and that is specifically why i said a jeffrey epstein. unlike republicans, i at least don’t go out and just tell lies. because it was not the same one? that’s fine. but when lee zeldin had something to say, all he had to say was, it was a different jeffrey epstein. he admitted that he did receive donations from a jeffrey epstein. so, at least i wasn’t trying to mislead people.” zeldin posted a video of crockett’s comments and responded, via x: “when you find yourself in a hole, it’s best to stop digging.” in another x post, zeldin wrote, “it’s such a foolish bet to double down on stupid. i’ll always be ready to push back with receipts. … [t]he right move for crockett would have been to just confess her mistake, and ditch the spin job.” business insider, citing the center for responsive politics, reported that epstein, the convicted sex abuser, made a single $, donation to george h.w. bush’s unsuccessful reelection campaign. former rep. rick lazio, a republican who represented new york’s nd district, got $, worth of donations from epstein in . but as the center for responsive politics reported in , while epstein donated to various republican candidates and groups over the years, the vast majority of his donations were to democratic candidates and groups, including former president bill clinton and sens. john kerry and chris dodd. communications from jeffries’ campaign comer, who chairs the house oversight committee, also linked campaign fundraising efforts on behalf of house minority leader hakeem jeffries to epstein, citing a solicitation email sent to epstein in seeking his support. jeffries denied any knowledge of the email and called comer “a stone cold liar.” speaking on the house floor on nov. , comer said the email “shows democrat fundraisers invited epstein to an event or to meet privately with hakeem jeffries as part of their effort to win a majority. hakeem jeffries’ campaign solicited money from jeffrey epstein. that is what we found in the last document batch.” documents released by republicans on the oversight committee include a may , , campaign solicitation to epstein distributed by the fundraising firm dynamic srg, seeking participation in a democratic fundraising dinner and offering “an opportunity to get to know hakeem better.” comer shared the email from dynamic srg in a post on x. the email reads, in part: “dear jeffrey — we are thrilled to announce that we are working with congressman hakeem jeffries, one of the rising stars in the new york congressional delegation. sometimes referred to as ‘brooklyn’s barack’, he is a staunch supporter of president obama and a progressive voice for the people of new york city. … hakeem is committed to electing a democratic majority in and is encouraging his friends to participate in the dccc/dscc fundraising dinner with president obama this coming monday night. shoot us an email or give us a call … if you would like to get involved with the dinner, or would like to get an opportunity to get to know hakeem better.” jeffries responded to comer at a press briefing on nov. , saying, “i have no idea what james comer is talking about in terms of anything that any prior consultant may have sent. i had no idea about that either, but james comer apparently made the representation on the floor of the house that i sat down with jeffrey epstein, had dinner with jeffrey epstein, have contributions from jeffrey epstein. he’s a stone cold liar, and james comer knows it.” jeffries also told cnn, “i have no recollection of the email” referred to by comer. “i’ve never had a conversation with [epstein], never met him, know nothing about him other than the extreme things that he’s been convicted of doing,” jeffries said, and added that he had never received a political donation from epstein. comer responded to jeffries’ “liar” comment by posting the email, which comer’s office has said “speaks for itself.” we reached out to dynamic srg for comment on jeffries’ knowledge of the email solicitation and to whom it was sent, but we did not receive a response. we could find no record of political donations from epstein to jeffries. editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. please consider a donation. credit card donations may be made through our “donate” page. if you prefer to give by check, send to: factcheck.org, annenberg public policy center, p.o. box , philadelphia, pa .",Misleading
115,"addressing a meeting of mcdonald’s restaurant owners, president donald trump distorted his predecessor’s record on employment, falsely claiming that government jobs were increasing while “real jobs” were declining. the number of private-sector jobs increased every year under former president joe biden’s term and was up about % by the time he left office. at the mcdonald’s impact summit on nov. in washington, d.c., trump told the franchise owners and operators, “government jobs were going up, real jobs were going down. … you are so damn lucky that i won that election.” the president also claimed later, “in nine months, we’ve lifted over , americans off of food stamp[s], and that’s a record.” enrollment in the supplemental nutrition assistance program, formerly called food stamps, declined more than that in the final months of biden’s presidency. government jobs vs. private-sector jobs when trump said that “government jobs were going up, real jobs were going down” under biden, we assume he meant private-sector jobs when referring to “real” jobs. but the number of private-sector jobs grew every year of biden’s term. the white house didn’t respond to our question about trump’s claim. the number of private-sector jobs increased by . million under biden, an .% increase, according to bureau of labor statistics data. government jobs also increased by . million, or .%, a slower rate than private-sector jobs. some of biden’s gains, as we’ve noted, were due to recovery following the covid- pandemic. so, the job gains were larger earlier in his presidency. under trump, between january and september, the last month for which data are available, the number of private-sector jobs increased by ,, a .% increase. that was slower private-sector job growth than the same time period during biden’s last year in office, when private-sector jobs increased by , jobs, a .% increase. previously, trump has accurately said that during biden’s last two years in office, about % of the jobs added were government jobs. but as we’ve written, about % of those jobs were positions in state and local government, where biden would have no direct influence. trump did cut about , federal government jobs as of september, according to preliminary bls data, while , federal government jobs were added in the same period during biden’s last year in office. the decline during trump’s first nine months was due partly to the efforts of his new department of government efficiency, or doge, purportedly to reduce government costs and increase efficiency. however, hundreds of employees who were fired have been rehired in recent months, according to reports from npr and the associated press, and some government departments, such as immigration and customs enforcement and customs and border protection, have seen a surge in hiring. overall, government jobs — including federal, state and local positions — increased by , jobs from january to september. changes in snap enrollment touting his other economic policies, trump also said in his address to mcdonald’s owners, “in nine months, we’ve lifted over , americans off of food stamp[s], and that’s a record.” according to u.s. department of agriculture data, . million people in . million households, or nearly in every americans, received benefits from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, or snap, in may, the most recent month for which data is available. as trump said, more than , people stopped receiving snap assistance between january and may, according to the usda. but kate bauer, an associate professor of nutritional sciences at the university of michigan school of public health, told us that the decline in snap recipients since january is not “a record.” between october and january , the month the trump administration began, snap enrollment declined by ,, bauer said in an email. “based just on this, , wouldn’t be a record decline. in general, participation has been bouncing around” between million and million over the past few years, she said. from september to january , snap enrollment did increase by , individuals, and during biden’s entire time in office, snap participation went up by about .%, or , people. we asked the white house about the president’s claim that , was “a record” decrease in snap participants. white house spokesperson anna kelly told us in an email, “president trump’s proven economic formula of tax cuts, deregulation, and unleashing american energy has cooled inflation, raised real wages, and promoted growth. as a result,” kelly said, “americans have been lifted off of snap thanks to this president’s successful policies.” sara bleich, a professor of public health policy at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, told us, “by design, snap is countercyclical, meaning that enrollment is designed to increase during economic downturns and decrease as the economy improves. during the second quarter of , the economy was a bit stronger and monthly snap enrollment numbers are lower in may/june compared to january . all that is perfectly normal and expected.” bleich said “several intentional actions by the trump administration during that period may have dampened enrollment.” she cited trump’s executive order in february that “directed federal agencies to block undocumented people from accessing public benefits (who by the way were already ineligible for snap but this may have discouraged participation among immigrants who are eligible).” bleich also said that stricter work requirements for snap applicants included in trump’s one big beautiful bill act will result in “more declines in snap participation going forward.” “bottom line, it is not really accurate to say that people are being ‘lifted out of the program,'” bleich said. “snap is operating as normal (with people rolling off as the economy improves) and participation has simultaneously been discouraged by deliberate actions to dampen participation.” editor’s

117,"q: will u.s. citizens receive stimulus or tariff-based checks of $, in november? a: no checks are being issued. president donald trump said he wants to use tariff revenue to give “dividend” payments of “at least $,” to “middle-income people and lower-income people.” but no formal plan has been finalized and approved by congress. fiscal policy experts say there’s not enough tariff revenue for that. full answer a bogus online post falsely claims that this month the federal government will issue “a $, direct deposit payment for eligible u.s. citizens” in three phases from nov. through nov. . there are no such direct deposits scheduled and no checks in the mail. president donald trump has only talked about using revenue collected from tariffs, or customs duties, on imported foreign goods to reduce the federal debt and make “rebate” or “dividend” payments to americans. he reiterated his wishes on nov. . “people that are against tariffs are fools!,” trump wrote on truth social that day. “we are taking in trillions of dollars and will soon begin paying down our enormous debt, $ trillion. record investment in the usa, plants and factories going up all over the place. a dividend of at least $ a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.” he made his pitch again the next day while taking press questions in the oval office. “without tariffs, we would be — this country would be in such trouble, as they were for many years,” he said. “that’s why we owe $ trillion. and one of the things we’re going to do, we’re going to issue a dividend to our middle-income people and lower-income people of about $,. and we’re going to use the remaining tariffs to lower our debt. however, the u.s. has not made “trillions of dollars” from tariffs, as the president’s remarks may suggest. he appears to get to “trillions” by counting unspecified financial investments in the u.s. that companies or countries have pledged to make, which isn’t the same thing as “trillions” in revenue for the federal government. we asked the white house for an accounting of trump’s “trillions” calculation, but we did not get a response. photo by jeff mccollough / stock.adobe.com. multiple experts on fiscal policy have pointed out that, based on tariff revenue alone, the math for trump’s proposed dividend and debt payment plan doesn’t quite work. “the president just proposed a $, tariff ‘dividend’ for each person, excluding high-income earners,” erica york, vice president of federal tax policy for the pro-business tax foundation, wrote in an x thread that began on nov. . “if the cutoff is $,, m adults would qualify, for a cost near $ billion. if kids qualify, that grows.” “only problem,” york said, “new tariffs have raised $ billion so far,” although she noted that the tax foundation estimates that net revenue from trump’s tariffs would equal about $ billion in fiscal year , which began oct. . (including preexisting tariffs, the government, according to treasury department data, collected nearly $ billion total in customs duties in fiscal year , which ended sept. .) the committee for a responsible federal budget estimates that tariffs will bring in a bit more revenue: about $ billion per year, starting in . but the nonpartisan group said that still may not be enough depending on who qualified for trump’s payments. “assuming these dividends are designed like the covid-era economic impact payments, which went to both adults and children, we estimate each round of payments would cost about $ billion,” crfb said. the full pandemic payments, which were made at three different times between and , went to single tax filers with less than $, in gross income and jointly filing married couples who made less than $,. the payments began to phase out, or were reduced, for individuals and couples earning more than those thresholds. crfb said that, on a revenue neutral basis, the dividend payments could be made “every other year, starting in early ,” if trump planned to issue them on a recurring basis. but if the supreme court agrees with lower courts and rules that the majority of the tariffs that trump unilaterally imposed this year are illegal, the remaining tariffs on imports would only raise enough money to make payments after seven years, crfb said. in addition, using all of the tariff revenue for rebates or dividends would mean that there would be no money left over to pay down the federal debt, as trump also said he wants to do. in fact, issuing such rebates would increase the debt (which now totals $ trillion, as trump said, including money the government owes to itself). “using all the tariff revenue for rebates would push debt to % of gross domestic product (gdp) by instead of % under current law; if $, dividends are paid annually, debt would reach % gdp,” crfb said. furthermore, while the nonpartisan tax policy center also estimates that tariffs trump had announced through oct. will raise close to $ billion in ($ billion), it said those same policies “will impose an average burden of about $, per tax unit in calendar year ,” reducing the economic impact of any dividend payments to individuals. that burden on households is because the tariffs are mostly paid by u.s. importers – not foreign countries, as trump has said – who often pass at least some of their costs onto american consumers through higher prices on goods. the tax foundation estimates a lower average tariff burden on households, but it would still be $, in , the organization says. white house press secretary karoline leavitt said in a nov. press briefing that the trump administration is serious about trying to make the dividend payments a reality. “the white house is committed to making that happen, yes, and we are currently exploring all legal options to get that done,” she said when a reporter asked about trump’s recent comments. “i don’t have a timeline for you or any further details, but i can confirm for you that the president made it clear he wants to make it happen.” the president’s “team of economic advisers are looking into it,” she said. in an interview on fox news on nov. , treasury secretary scott bessent said there are “a lot of options here that the president’s talking about,” including $, rebates for “families making less than, say, $,,” and those options are “in discussion” among white house officials. bessent also suggested the tax cuts in the one big beautiful bill act should be counted as rebates to working families. “what we did with the tax bill is actually financing the president’s no tax on tips, overtime, social security, and the big refunds you’re going to see are a result of that,” bessent said. “so that’s another payment to the american people.” in addition, he said, starting next year, the law will provide $, for investment accounts — so-called “trump accounts” — for newborns. “so, that’s another $, for working families,” bessent said. we’d note that any dividend payments, like the three rounds of stimulus payments issued during the pandemic, would have to be authorized by congress. editor’s note: factcheck.org does not accept advertising. we rely on grants and individual donations from people like you. please consider a donation. credit card donations may be made through our “donate” page. if you prefer to give by check, send to: factcheck.org, annenberg public policy center, p.o. box , philadelphia, pa .",Misleading

123,"claim: a new california law set to take effect in will require kids ages - to -years-old to sit in a booster seat while riding in a vehicle. rating: about this rating mostly false context it’s misleading to assert that the law “requires” a booster seat for the specified age group. the law only requires children to sit in a booster seat if they do not meet the requirements of a new five-step test, or conditions for being seated comfortably and safely when constrained by a seat belt. such a test is more a question of body size rather than age and will not apply to all children. claims that a new california law will require children - to -years-old to use a booster seat while riding in a vehicle circulated online in mid-to-late november . users on social media platforms like x (archived) and particularly facebook (archived, archived) shared their frustrations with the alleged change, with one parent on tiktok (archived) sharing a video of their unamused teenage daughter attempting to sit in such a booster seat. the assertion that the new law will ""require"" teens in california to sit in a booster seat was overstated, and as such, we have rated this claim as false. it is accurate to say that a new law could result in some kids ages to having to sit in a booster seat. specifically, the updated law, which was approved by california gov. gavin newsom on oct. , and will go into effect jan. , , outlined a new ""-step test"" that established requirements to be met for an individual to be considered ""properly restrained by a safety belt"" in the eyes of california state law. the new requirements offered more specificity as to what is legally considered ""properly restrained."" those requirements were outlined in the bill as follows: () the child or ward is sitting all the way back against the auto seat. () the knees of the child or ward bend over the edge of the auto seat. () the shoulder belt snugly crosses the center of the child's chest and shoulder, not the child's neck. () the lap belt is as low as possible and is touching the child or ward's thighs. () the child or ward can stay seated like this for the whole trip. by comparison, the bill stated that ""existing law defines, for purposes of the above provisions, 'properly restrained by a safety belt' to mean that the lap belt crosses the hips or upper thighs of the occupant and the shoulder belt, if present, crosses the chest in front of the occupant."" the bill stated that the old requirements would ""remain in effect only until january , ,"" and the new requirements would ""become operative"" on the same day. the bill was supported by the automobile club of california, aaa northern california, nevada & utah, the national highway safety administration and the california department of public health, among other public safety organizations. current california law, as of this writing, stated ""a child or ward under years of age who is feet inches in height or taller to be properly restrained by a safety belt rather than by a child passenger restraint system."" under the new updated law, height would still be a consideration as it would be a key determining factor in one passing the ""-step test,"" but also takes into consideration other safety concerns for children. a document capturing the assembly floor analysis of the bill stated, ""recent data suggests that the minimum height requirements do not adequately capture the safety needs of children in vehicles."" according to the california highway patrol (chp), as of this writing, children are ""ready for a booster seat when they have outgrown the weight or height limit of their forward-facing harnesses, which is typically between and pounds,"" and should use them ""until they are at least '"" and between and years old."" chp further pointed out that ""safety belts are designed for -pound male adults, so it's no wonder that research shows poorly fitting adult belts can injure children."" minnesota passed a similar law in and louisiana in . in sum, users speculating about their older teens being ""required"" to use a booster seat until they are likely have little to be concerned about if their child falls within the average growth rates. so while california did vote to update its laws surrounding seat belt requirements for children, it is false to say that the new law ""requires"" booster seats for kids aged to .",Misleading
124,"a rumor that scotland accidentally launched an initiative to allow women to go topless named ""t***ies for cities"" circulated online in early december . according to the rumors, the country's authorities were intending to start a potato-growing scheme instead, which it intended to call ""tatties for cities.""

(x user @cecegkh) snopes readers searched the site looking for information about the claim. the assertion was false. if the claim were true, reputable entertainment and sports media outlets would have reported on it, especially given that jordan is notorious for not speaking about politics. searching google, bing, yahoo and duck duck go for the claim found that no such news reports existed, only social media posts. instead, snopes was able to trace the claim back to a now-deleted post from a facebook user named richie furay. that user shared a follow-up post referencing the deleted claim about jordan while other posts spread the rumor. furay is best known as a founding member of the bands buffalo springfield, poco and the southern-hillman-furay band. however, it was unclear whether the facebook account that spread the claim about jordan was actually furay or just someone attempting to impersonate him. snopes reached out to furay to ask for comment on the story but had not heard back at time of publication. this is not the first time snopes has checked a supposed statement made by jordan in support of trump. posts on social media falsely claimed jordan had endorsed trump just days before the election.",Misleading
127,"claim: a video authentically shows a raccoon breaking into a liquor store, drinking alcohol and passing out on the bathroom floor. rating: about this rating fake context while the story itself is true, the video was generated by artificial intelligence. in early december , a video supposedly showing legitimate footage of a raccoon breaking into a liquor store, drinking alcohol and then passing out on the bathroom floor circulated widely online. the clip spread on facebook, x, instagram and tiktok. while the story itself is true, the above video was generated by artificial intelligence (ai). ""yes, that is an ai generated video and is not our store or raccoon,"" said pat kane, a spokesperson for virginia alcohol beverage and control authority, which oversees the state-run liquor store in ashland targeted by the real raccoon's drunken ransacking. as such, we have rated this video fake. kane said via email that the real raccoon entered the store on nov. after business hours and ""impacted the security system,"" resulting in a power outage alert from the security company. the next morning, the store manager found the intoxicated ""black friday bandit"" passed out on the floor. it had damaged bottles of spirits worth about $, according to kane. hanover county animal protection and shelter in virginia, the local government's official animal control department, released real images of the raccoon post-rampage. (the county is even selling merchandise of the tipsy trash panda, proceeds of which will go to the county's animal care and protection efforts.) reputable news broadcasters also reported on legitimate surveillance videos of the raccoon running amok, which were first published by abc news, a television station in virginia. snopes independently verified these videos via kane, who sent us the clips through email. spotting the ai behind the video as evidenced, the real surveillance videos are much grainier than the ai-generated video (as surveillance videos usually are). there are several inconsistencies in the fake video that clearly indicated the use of artificial intelligence. zooming showed that labels for the liquor bottles blurred into one another and wobbled as the video played, a telltale sign of an ai-generated video. the labels were also gibberish. furthermore, within the ai video, the background of the first clip in the (fake) daylight — before the ai video jumps to the raccoon in the dark — shows liquor bottle shelves, which mysteriously disappear to be replaced with an exit sign in the second clip. examples that indicate the video is ai-generated, including gibberish labels and an inconsistent background.

141,"claim: following reporting that the department of defense executed a likely illegal follow-up strike to kill survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat, former fox news host megyn kelly said in a december podcast episode that she'd want to see the survivors ""killed in the water"" and that ""i'd really like to see them suffer. i would like trump and hegseth to make it last a long time so they lose a limb and bleed out."" rating: about this rating correct attribution context kelly prefaced her defense of the strikes by saying that ""the armed forces should not commit war crimes."" in december , social media users widely shared a clip of megyn kelly, a former fox news host, talking on a podcast about a reported strike by the u.s. military on an alleged drug boat. one post on x (archived) said: megyn kelly on alleged war crimes: ""i really do kind of not only wanna see them killed in the water, whether they're on the boat or in the water, but i'd really like to see them suffer. i would like [president donald] trump and [defense secretary pete] hegseth to make it last a long time so they lose a limb and bleed out."" the comment appeared to be in response to recent scrutiny of hegseth over a report that the military carried out a likely illegal follow-up strike to kill survivors of an initial attack in the caribbean. users also shared the quote on instagram (archived), reddit (archived) and bluesky (archived). the quote about seeing ""them killed in the water"" and suffering was correctly attributed to kelly, who was commenting on reports that the department of defense carried out a follow-up strike on survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat. kelly discussed the reported strike on the dec. , , episode of her podcast ""the megyn kelly show."" the quote widely shared across social media came at about : in the youtube video of the episode, as she spoke with commentator mark halperin. the full context of kelly's quote, including the commentary on scrutiny around the strikes that the quote was a part of, was as followed (emphasis ours): in any event, it's like to me it's kind of annoying to even debate it. i do think our soldiers and, you know, all armed forces should not commit war crimes. definitely on team , don't commit a war crime. but i also feel like i object to even the scrutiny of this event because it's all manufactured. it's only being done to retroactively justify this, you know, seditious six and their — that's what hegseth is calling them — and their video which was based on nothing. they're just now digging. it's a fishing expedition and it does feel a little, you know, stalin's right-hand man-eqsue like, ""show me the man and i'll show you the crime."" that's how it feels to me, so i'm really not that into it, nor do i really care that we're killing the drug boat guys trying to kill my kids and yours right now by bringing their fentanyl to the united states to try to get our kids when they go to college with, you know, some drug in some moment of weakness where they think they're taking a xanax like what happened to poor eric bowling's child, and instead it's laced with fentanyl. so, i really do kind of not only want to see them killed in the water, whether they're on the boat or in the water, but i'd really like to see them suffer. i would like trump and hegseth to make it last a long time so that they lose a limb and bleed out a little — like i'm really having a difficult time ginning up sympathy for these guys who seconds earlier almost got taken out by the initial bomb, but because they managed to get ejected, you know, a little too soon had to be taken out in the water. i realize legally it may make a difference, but truly, mark, this is a tough case to really gin up the sympathies of the american people. since september , the trump administration has carried out a number of strikes in south american waters of the caribbean sea against what it has alleged are drug-trafficking boats. in late november, the washington post reported that hegseth gave the order to ""kill everybody"" on a boat the military targeted in the strike in question in september. once it became evident that two people had survived the initial strike, the commander of the operation ""ordered a second strike to comply with hegseth's instructions,"" according to the post. since then, hegseth has acknowledged that u.s. armed forces carried out a follow-up strike on survivors of that initial strike, claiming it occurred due to the ""fog of war."" members of congress have scrutinized hegseth and his role in the reported strikes. the associated press reported that several legal experts ""believed the second strike violated peacetime laws and those governing armed conflict."" it also reported that the department of defense's manual on the laws of armed conflict specifically cites striking survivors of a sunken ship as being illegal. under a subsection on the duty of individual members of the armed forces to refuse to comply with ""clearly illegal orders"" to commit war crimes, the manual at the time of the strikes said (page , emphasis ours): ""the requirement to refuse to comply with orders to commit law of war violations applies to orders to perform conduct that is clearly illegal or orders that the subordinate knows, in fact, are illegal. for example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.""",Misleading

seconds later between ::-::. numerous professionally captured still photos also showed trump's eyes partially or fully closed at various moments during the meeting. while photographers possibly captured those pictures during moments of blinking or momentary eye-closing, the fact remained that videos depicted a drowsy trump yawning and numerous times slowly dropping his head to begin falling asleep. for further reading, we previously reported about other times users falsely, or without presenting credible evidence, alleged videos showed trump falling asleep, including while attending pope francis' funeral service and during the republican national convention. we also dispelled similar claims regarding videos purportedly depicting former president joe biden as dozing off.",Misleading
